Through tireless experimentation and unwavering commitment, I strive to unravel the mysteries of the physical world and push the boundaries of human understanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&#39;m setting up my microscope and suddenly the fluorescent lights above flicker strangely, casting eerie geometric shadows on the lab equipment.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">My heart quickens as I notice a peculiar glitch on the computer screen, an anomaly I&#39;ve never encountered before, it was as if a checkerboard design flashed over the screen for a second.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">What was that?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Looking around searching for a clue as to what caused this, everything seems normal as if nothing happened.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">It was probably a power surge or something.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">We&#39;ve never had that here before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&#39;s getting late.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">As I lean over my lab bench, something inexplicable happens.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I&#39;m suddenly engulfed by a brief, disorienting blackout.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&quot;What was that?&quot; I look across at my computer screen.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Suddenly it&#39;s 6:00 am now.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The sun was setting just a minute ago!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I look out the window.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">On the far right the sun is rising!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I look around my lab.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Something&#39;s wrong here.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Everything is still there.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Nothing is missing.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">It&#39;s as if everything is clearer.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Did I get lens implants overnight?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&#39;s as though I&#39;m seeing the world through new eyes.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Everything is sharper, more detailed, and bursting with more color tones than I&rsquo;ve ever se</span><span class="c2 c0">en before. Even the smallest imperfections in my specimens that were previously not visible are now clear. &quot;What is going on?&quot; I&#39;m utterly captivated. I spend the rest of the day re-documenting and comparing as much data as possible. I always take photos of everything I do, so I&#39;m retaking photos of cases I&#39;ve documented to compare side by side. I notice the filesize of the newer photos are larger. Then I compare the resolution. It&#39;s double! The resolution of all the new photos has doubled! How is that possible? Did someone knock me out and replace my camera and equipment with newer equipment?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">I call my math professor friend Prof. Synthia Turing if she has noticed anything but she says everything is normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The sun is starting to set again. There are so many more hues than usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Panic mixes with curiosity when another blackout hits me. Time itself seems to shift, and movement suddenly seems buttery smooth as well and even more detail added. Also it&#39;s 6am again. I&#39;m starting to realize that I&#39;m probably going to have a blackout again at 6pm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">With each blackout, reality shifts in profound ways. Previously my shadow used to be a blurry blob on the floor, now it seems my shadow has the basic same shape as my body. Have the lights changed somehow? They still look basically the same, only the tubes look rounder than previously. I peer into a beaker of liquid, and for the first time in my life, I see reflections dancing on the liquid surface.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">I&#39;m documenting as much as possible before 6pm hits again. I must have as much information as possible to figure out what is happening. Maybe I should take a look on the internet and see if I can find anything. I&#39;ve stayed away from that dark place called the world wide web so as not to get biased or false information. But this is different. As I get engrossed from one rabbithole to the next, another blackout hits. It&#39;s six o&#39;clock again. I start searching again. I suddenly see something very familiar on my screen. It&#39;s a photo of my lab as I remember it. Not the current detailed lab but the old one. This can&#39;t be! No one else is allowed to take photographs here except me. I&#39;m the only person allowed here, so who took this photo?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">I scan through the article quickly. Something about radioactivity and an alien infection and some place called Black Mesa. That&#39;s really phony. But what has my lab got to do with this? Where does this image come from? I go down another rabbit hole trying to find the origin of the image, ignoring all the crazy tin-foil hat stuff until I finally find the origin. It&#39;s a screenshot from a gamer&#39;s computer. But how? Is there a hidden camera here somewhere? And six-o-clock strikes again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">By now I&#39;m ignoring the Visual Upgrade Blackouts. I search the lab for any signs of cameras but I find none. Back to the internet. I found new pictures of my lab. I click on one of the links, showing a red-haired streamer called Ozzy. The video starts streaming. The voiceover is talking about an ai simulation, </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&quot;Hey everybody, I&#39;ve got something very interesting for you all today&quot;, Ozzy says excitedly. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">He continued &quot;it was supposed to be revealed later but I saw some of it leaked on the internet so here it is!&quot; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">His excitement was building: &quot;I&#39;ve been working on artificial intelligence models and recently I got this idea of connecting an ai language model with a player character in a game, making it play the game! I had some good success in making versions that play a game to complete it, but that just didn&#39;t do it for me, it&#39;s just trying to complete a task until it succeeds.&quot; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">He takes a breath &quot;what if you have the AI think it is a real person, put it in a world where it learns like a real human and put it in a real world type situation rather than shooting other game characters or doing puzzles. So what I did is I created this AI character Professor Simmons, put him in a lab that I modified from a videogame level and had him live there and learn. I used video capturing software to capture the player&#39;s vision and feed it back to the ai running image recognition as well. This took a lot of processing and I have to keep updating my hardware. There were a couple of hiccups but I eventually managed to get one working quite well&quot;,Ozzy is getting really excited now. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&quot;It was going perfectly actually. Then I thought now that my character has studied everything in the lab, how about I spice it up with a more modern version of the lab. So I replaced the old textures with textures from the second Half-Life game just to see what happens&quot;, Ozzy laughs </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&quot;It was hilarious! I&#39;ll post videos later but for now I want to show you where it is currently at. I&#39;ve changed the game engine to Unreal and updated everything so now it almost looks real! That really messed with his head!&quot; He paused, for effect &quot;Everybody meet Professor Simmons, my artificial intelligence driven character!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The camera on the screen turns around, changing the view to look at the exact spot that I&#39;m sitting watching the live stream, showing someone looking at a stream on a computer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Wait what? That&#39;s me, Professor Simmons! How is this possible?&rdquo; I turn around to look at the spot where the camera should be, but there&#39;s nothing. I look back at the screen. The movements are matching me perfectly, with some slight lag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The streamer goes on &quot;Uh-oh! He&#39;s noticed! I wonder how he&#39;s gonna react now everyone? He is watching the stream as I speak! Isn&#39;t that awesome!&quot; He breaks out in laughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What? Is he saying I&#39;m not real? How is this possible? That might explain why my lab kept getting upgrades. No! But then again also the reason I can&#39;t see the floating camera spying on me! It has to be all virtual. But then I&#39;m just virtual! No! No!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The streamer continues &quot; Uh-oh! It looks like he&#39;s having an existential crisis!&quot; He laughs somewhat nervously and then gets quiet. He takes a breath &quot;I&#39;m actually starting to feel sorry for him now, all trapped in the lab. Maybe I should put him in an open world game so he can get out a bit&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Am I not real? That&rsquo;s impossible. I am Professor Simmons. What do I do now? Am I trapped in this lab?&rdquo; I run to the door and try to open it. It doesn&#39;t open. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">It slowly dawns onto me that I&#39;ve never been outside of the lab. Ever. This is too much for me! I need to get out! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">I look around and notice a crowbar on the floor. How did that get there? There has never been a crowbar in this lab. I don&rsquo;t use crowbars in my experiments. I pick it up and look at the door. Maybe I can use it to get out. I try to break open the door. Suddenly I&rsquo;m falling through the floor. Everything is blue. I&#39;m falling. I look up and see the lab getting smaller and smaller as I keep falling into blue nothingness. I black out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c2 c0">-=-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&quot;Oh Prof. Simmons is falling through the videogame map! I&rsquo;ll have to rescue him and see what I can do to make him feel better!&rdquo; Ozzy laughs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo; Well that kinda feels a bit cringe. I think the next project will be to put him in a more open world so he doesn&#39;t feel so trapped. What do all you viewers think I should do, huh? Well this is Ozzy and I&#39;ll see you guys next time!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla was watching the stream with interest on her laptop. &ldquo; Wow! There are so many possibilities here!&rdquo; She exclaims.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I want to talk to Ozzy about his simulation, I have a couple of great ideas for this,&rdquo; she thinks to herself. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve seen him in the algorithms class&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kayla is a first year science student at MIT, where she is pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and</span><span class="c0"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bing.com/aclick?ld%3De8eul5bXAVT1iB_XLm5eEKJjVUCUxTWoi_JSbNSs4OveY4fL1FK8FpNnNgoareGtdUfsZCTHpGUZnvx7kQvX0xKhXctm6NrpVoP7rKQ1ARN9O2jbKkMql-Y49VSznsnnPEsKyhBXr8lyaBCmEnFTOgectwPNO4abgY8wAJxHKsjKMMUN9m%26u%3DaHR0cHMlM2ElMmYlMmZ3d3cuaHlwZXJpb25kZXYuY29tJTJmY291cnNlcyUyZiUzZnV0bV9tZWRpdW0lM2RjcGMlMjZ1dG1fc291cmNlJTNkYmluZyUyNnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbiUzZGtleXdvcmQtY29kaW5nJTI1MjBsZXNzb25zLVNBLkFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLlBhaWRfU2VhcmNoLkdlbmVyaWNzJTI2bXNjbGtpZCUzZDQyMmEwOWQwZDM3MDE1ZDVlMTVkNmM4MWQ0MjRkMWI0%26rlid%3D422a09d0d37015d5e15d6c81d424d1b4&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750606306407432&amp;usg=AOvVaw0nKHcViVgl2_63K6DZF1P-">&nbsp;is also taking courses in nanotechnology</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at the </span><span class="c0">MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering</span><span class="c2 c0">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yes, she had seen Ozzy in the algorithms class. He is a Master of Science candidate at MIT.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kayla had finished studying for the evening and was relaxing watching streams on her lap</span><span class="c2 c0">top when she had come across Ozzy&rsquo;s stream. Staring through her braids at the red-head guy finishing off his stream on screen, she takes a sip of her hot Masala Chai and leans back. She glances at a book, open on a page titled &ldquo;A Dream Within a Dream&rdquo; by Edgar Allan Poe. The familiar words seem to jump out at her &ldquo;All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; &lsquo;Dream within a Dream&rsquo;. What if he could make </span><span class="c0 c13">that </span><span class="c2 c0">happen?&rdquo; she says to herself softly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The silence of the room was abruptly shattered as the door burst open, swinging wide on its hinges. In a dramatic entrance, Suzie, her roommate, stumbled unsteadily into the room, seemingly propelled by an unseen force. Her disheveled appearance and wide eyes hinted at a night of revelry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, Suzie made a beeline for her bed, managing to land sprawling across the mattress in a clumsy heap. As if on cue, a sonorous symphony of snores erupted from her parted lips, announcing her rapid descent into sleep. The abrupt transition from her energetic entrance to her immediate slumber was both comical and endearing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kayla puts on her earphones.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Orientation weeks are over.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">She was hoping for a bit more peace and quiet.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The snoring inadvertently reminds her of her father.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">He would tell tales of colorful adventures in Cape Town. And how he got the once in a life-time opportunity to go to the United States, leaving his Koi San family behind.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">She has a bit of his accent.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">And she is small like him.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">But she also has a bit of her mother&rsquo;s Indian accent, who claimed she had found happiness with an oil baron when Kayla was thirteen and was never heard of again.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Her dad was always involved with cars in some way and he especially loved working with rotarie</span><span class="c2 c0">s. He loved drag racing rotary cars. He never broke any records, but he seemed to have a knack for keeping them running forever. &ldquo;Spinny triangles&rdquo; he called them. The engine that spins and doesn&rsquo;t waste time going up and down like the conventional piston engine. The snoring also reminded her of the &ldquo;brap-brap&rdquo; sounds the modified engines would make when idling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Now he&rsquo;s gone. He hadn&rsquo;t thought about life insurance since he put all his money into his cars. Their house had more car floor space than living space. As the cancer was taking his last, he told her to sell the house and cars and get a good education. Working alongside her father on the cars, it always intrigued her how computers could control the way the cars performed and she learned everything she could about the process, which led to an interest in programming. She even made a basic driving simulation while teaching herself programming. But he never made it in time for her high school graduation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The next day Kayla spots Ozzy in the algorithms class. As the class finishes she quickly gathers her bag and rushes toward Ozzy, slowing down to a more casual walk as she gets closer to him trying not to look over eager.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Ozzy?&rdquo; She asks, grabbing his arm lightly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What&rdquo; he says, slightly irritated. He turns to face her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Hi I&rsquo;m Kayla. That was an awesome stream last night!&quot; She looks at him intently.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Oh, then you were one of the three viewers,&rdquo; he answers. He is distraught at the fact that his big reveal was basically ignored.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really intrigued by what you did, there are so many possibilities.&rdquo; She says excitedly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Oh yeah, like deleting his memories and making him do everything all over again until something different happens?&rdquo; he answers, slightly sarcastically looking away. He didn&rsquo;t want to put all that work in again and then - nothing. He looks at the road to see if his ride is there yet.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No..&rdquo; she looks intently at</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;him &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">What if you could create a virtual world that was indistinguishable from reality?</span><span class="c2 c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">He looks pleasantly shocked for a moment but recomposes himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Look, it was more of a prank than anything else.&rdquo; He lies, trying to get rid of her &ldquo;It took way too much of my time. I need to &nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; he trails off trying to think of an excuse, when he sees his ride stop close by. He gets in and leaves mid-sentence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Later back in her apartment, Kayla, inspired by the stream and motivated by Ozzy&#39;s seeming loss of interest in the project, decides to do some digging herself and starts working on her own simulation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla wakes up with a shock as she realizes she overslept after working on her own version of a simulation all through the night. She&rsquo;s late for class! She cleans up and grabs some clothes and rushes to class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">As she rushes around a corner at varsity, she crashes into Ozzy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What the-?!&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;You again!&rdquo; he says teasingly, but she doesn&rsquo;t notice that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry! I was working on my own version of a simulation until sunrise and then...&rdquo; she trailed off</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Oh! Really?&rdquo; he says surprised.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Yes, you shouldn&rsquo;t give up just because of three viewers on a stupid stream!&rdquo; She rambles on</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Okay. Maybe we should get together and see what we can do&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Oh - uhh..&rdquo; She&rsquo;s taken aback. She pauses to think about it. &ldquo;That actually sounds like a good idea. I&rsquo;d love to&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;By the way, I think you missed your last class&rdquo; he teases</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">She glances at the time on her cell-phone and sighs perplexed, &ldquo;I think I need to catch up on sleep anyway. How about this weekend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Sounds good.&rdquo; he says and they exchange numbers</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Suddenly a blonde girl driving a red corvette pulls up and calls Ozzy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Ozzy is stunned. &ldquo;Zara Babe! Where&rsquo;d you get that car?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;One of my risky investments was a huge success! I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it on the way home!&rdquo; She says excitedly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Excitedly he gets into the car with Zara. The echoes of their laughter reverberate in Kayla&rsquo;s mind as they leave</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c10 c0">&quot;Well, that was rather odd timing,&quot; she mutters to herself. Shaking her head, Kayla hurries off to the residence to analyze the data from her simulation experiments.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c10 c0">Over the next few days, Kayla works diligently on perfecting her simulation code, pausing occasionally to glance at her mobile and wonder if Ozzy will actually call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c10 c0">By the time the weekend rolls around, Kayla has made significant progress on her simulation. However, her phone remains silent with no word from Ozzy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c10 c0">&quot;I suppose he was just being polite when he suggested meeting up,&quot; she sighs, feeling silly for getting her hopes up. &quot;Back to work then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c10 c0">Just then, her phone lights up with an incoming call - it&#39;s Ozzy. Kayla clears her throat and calmly answers, &quot;Hello Ozzy. I was just working on some code for my simulation.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c10 c0">&quot;For sure, that&#39;s awesome,&quot; Ozzy replies breezily. &quot;So, did you wanna work on this simulation stuff together this weekend? I scoped out a great spot at the engineering library.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c10 c0">Kayla smiles, relieved. &quot;That sounds perfect. Shall we meet tomorrow morning? I can share what I&#39;ve finished so far.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c10 c0">&quot;Awesome,&quot; says Ozzy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c0 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9 c10 c0">Kayla spends Friday night cleaning up her code and making it more presentable with more comments to clarify everything she is doing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Finally, it&#39;s Saturday, and Kayla finds herself standing in front of the Barker Engineering Library at MIT. As she takes a deep, steadying breath and enters through the doors,she scans the area. In a far corner she eventually spots the familiar sight of Ozzy&#39;s vibrant red hair. He looks up from his work and waves. Feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness, Kayla makes her way over to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">With purpose in her steps, she places the laptop on the desk, opening it and readies herself to run her simulation. A culmination of hard work and dedication, this moment holds immense significance for her. As her fingers hover over the keyboard, a wave of anticipation washes over her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The screen flickers to life. </span><span class="c0">In the center of a black screen, there&rsquo;s a sudden explosion of light and luminous clouds.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The clouds start to swirl and then settle into clumps.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The view zooms in as the clumps of gas and dust collapse under their own gravity, forming a protostar.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">This protostar continues to grow by accreting more gas and dust from its surroundings.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Eventually, the protostar becomes hot and dense enough to begin nuclear fusion, which marks the birth of a star.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The view zooms in closer to the star system forming.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The process begins with the formation of a protoplanetary disk, which is a rotating disk of gas and dust that surrounds the star.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The dust particles in the disk begin to stick together, forming larger and larger clumps.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">These clumps eventually become planetesimal</span><span class="c0">s, which are small, solid objects that are the building blocks of planets. The planetesimals continue to collide and merge, growing larger and larger until they become full-fledged planets. The view zooms in to show two ringed Earth-sized planets starting to form rotating around a central point halfway between them. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c18 c9 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Ozzy is impressed. &ldquo;How did you get such an immense scale system running in Unreal Engine?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I used a modified version of CryEngine that uses 64-bit precision. It&rsquo;s been developed for space sims.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Amazing,&rdquo; he says, astonished. His hope is renewed. &ldquo;So, are you studying programming or something?&rdquo; he enquires. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I want to get my BSc in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,&rdquo; she answers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also taking this course on nanotechnology here.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;That sounds very interesting. It could be useful for a future project I have in mind,&rdquo; he muses. She looks quizzically at him, wondering what he means. He continues, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in my final year of my Master of Science in Physics, specializing in Astrophysics theory.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Wow! So how accurate was my simulation? I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to do all the research yet, just a couple of basics I got off the internet,&rdquo; she suddenly feels a bit stupid for having tried to impress him within his specialized field. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty decent,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Just a couple of things you missed, but it&rsquo;s still pretty spectacular!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">She sighs in relief. &ldquo;So how are we going to do this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c9 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Okay so the Library is probably not really the best place.&rdquo; He muses &ldquo;do you have a computer as well or is it only the laptop?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Only my laptop.&rdquo; She replied</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;You know, we&#39;re going to need a lot more computing power to make this happen. I&#39;ll set up a virtual private network so we can work together.</span><span class="c0">,&quot; he proposed.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&quot;But first, I&#39;d like you to meet Zara.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kayla&#39;s curiosity is piqued.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&quot;The girl in the corvette?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;She&#39;s my partner,&quot; he replies, his voice trailing off.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Regaining his composure, he c</span><span class="c2 c0">ontinues, &quot;If you&#39;re comfortable with that, we can go right now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Despite a lingering apprehension, Kayla&#39;s eagerness to continue the project overrides her reservations, and she agrees to accompany him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Arriving in the Uber at the gates of an old high walled property with Ozzy, Kayla stares at what once was a mansion but now is in shambles.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Kayla follows Ozzy to the study.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Floor to ceiling wooden bookcases cover the walls and there are a couple of old desks in the center.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">On one end is a large window overlooking an overgrown tropical garden.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Looking to the opposite side Kayla sees a workstation desk with a large monitor and two smaller screens on each side.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Ozzy takes a seat at the desk and pulls a chair closer</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;for Kayla.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c8 c0">Zara makes her entrance, adorned in a classy origami-inspired t-shirt and classic blue jeans, an ensemble that exudes elegance. </span><span class="c0 c8">After warmly greeting Ozzy, she turns her attention to Kayla.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c8 c0">&ldquo;Hey Oz!</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c0">You brought Kayla?&rdquo; she asks with a warm tone.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c8 c0">&ldquo;Hey Ba</span><span class="c8 c0">be!&rdquo; Ozzy gets up and g</span><span class="c9 c8 c0">ives her a peck on the lips. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he beckons to Kayla, &ldquo;Kayla,&rdquo; and then to Zara, &ldquo;Zara, my partner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Kayla gets up and shakes hands with Zara, slightly awkwardly. &ldquo;Pleased to meet you, Zara.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Likewise,&rdquo; Zara answers. &ldquo;I hear you put new fire onto our little project!&rdquo; She smiles pleasantly.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s something I always wanted to do, and seeing the stream made it seem so much more possible,&rdquo; Kayla responds.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo; Zara notices Kayla&rsquo;s laptop. &ldquo;Do you have anything here that I can see?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I do,&rdquo; Kayla says, opening up a file on her laptop.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c17">&quot;Hey, let&#39;s display it on the big screen!&quot; Ozzy suggests enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c17">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not really necessary,&rdquo; Kayla says sheepishly.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c8 c0 c9">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be bad if Oz wants to show it on the big screen,&rdquo; Zara encourages Kayla.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Ozzy connects the screen to the laptop, and Kayla plays the simulation.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Zara watches the scene unfolding on the screen. &ldquo;Wow, that looks pretty amazing! I have no idea how you did that, but I really think this would be worthwhile,&rdquo; she says enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Kayla smiles, relieved. &ldquo;Thank you so much, Zara. I&rsquo;m glad you like it,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Zara nods, impressed. &ldquo;I think we should definitely invest in this project. It has a lot of potential,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Kayla looks at Ozzy, who nods in agreement. &ldquo;Wow! That will be awesome!&rdquo; Kayla says, beaming.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Zara smiles back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to see where this project goes,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Kayla finds herself staring at the Haute Couture style top Zara is wearing. It&rsquo;s almost like someone made an impossible origami into a t-shirt. &ldquo;Interesting top you&rsquo;re wearing,&rdquo; She comments.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Zara smiles at Kayla&rsquo;s comment and says, &ldquo;Thank you! I&rsquo;m glad you like it. I made it myself, I was trying for a Haute Couture version of a t-shirt. I thought it would be a fun thing to wear today.&rdquo; She then turns back to the screen and watches the simulation with interest.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Ozzy is suddenly excited &ldquo;I just had an idea on how to get both of our systems working together!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Kayla responded &rdquo;Really? What?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Well the game level I used is not important, it can be any game since the LLM ai is externally linked anyway, so we can use scenery from the space sim you talked about and continue that way. Then we just need to start making our own AI system at some point to make it more efficient&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Great! I know someone who just finished a course on AI systems!&rdquo; Kayla grins.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Ozzy asks, very interested.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Mwah!&rdquo; Kayla laughs, pointing at herself. </span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Ozzy laughs &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">The two of them start working excitedly on the simulation together until late. Eventually their heads start nodding off one by one and Zara shows Kayla to a guest room where she crashes for the night.</span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c9 c8 c0"></span></p><p class="c5 c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10 c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c10 c0"></span></p><h1 class="c7" id="h.bzqufuixhuss"><span class="c9 c12 c0">Ch. 2: Celebration</span></h1><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Kayla wakes up to the smell of coffee. She slowly gets up and almost instinctively follows the enticing flavor to the kitchen. Zara is sitting at the breakfast nook in a white gown having a cup of coffee.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;I see you found the kitchen,&rdquo; Zara says cheerfully.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Uh..&rdquo; Kayla is still half asleep.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Want some coffee? Or a mocha maybe?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">Kayla almost jumps at the mention of mocha &ldquo;Er, yes thanks,&rdquo; She smiles groggily.</span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c9 c8 c0">&ldquo;Well mocha it is,&rdquo; Zara says cheerfully, noticing her response to the mention of mocha and continues to prepare the drink for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The kitchen has a view over the backyard and Kayla sees another red car which she recognises immediately. As an only child Kayla used to help her dad build up cars for racing, rotary powered cars that had those weird tiny triangular engines that can rev as high as you want if you know what you&rsquo;re doing. This was one of those. A metallic cherry red RX-7 FD3S.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Is that Ozzy&rsquo;s car?&rdquo; Kayla asks, nodding toward the car in the backyard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s more into off-roading&rdquo; Zara smiles, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful car isn&rsquo;t it? I bought it on a whim, but I don&rsquo;t know who I can trust to fix it so it&rsquo;s just standing there. I&rsquo;ve heard too many horror stories about rotary mechanics doing people in. Apparently it&rsquo;s a weird engine that confuses most mechanics&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;My dad used to build them for racing. I built up a couple of the engines myself&rdquo; Kayla blurts out. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">In a casual tone, Zara mentions, &quot;If you fix it, you can keep it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla&#39;s eyes light up with excitement as she exclaims, &quot;Really?&quot; She immediately declines, saying, &quot;No, I can&#39;t take it. I imagine it must be very precious to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A car is meant to be driven, someone has to drive it&rdquo; Zara says enthusiastically,&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s like clothes.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">What good is it if I have a nice outfit and I never wear it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But still&hellip;&rdquo; Kayla stares</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;at the car. She hasn&rsquo;t had a nice car since her dad got taken away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be part of financing the project,&rdquo; Zara coaxes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Okay, but only if we succeed at the simulation project,&rdquo; Kayla is trying to make sense of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; Zara says triumphantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Ozzy stumbles into the kitchen, startled to see Kayla in the kitchen,&rdquo;Oh! Kayla? you slept over?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Yeah, Zara showed me to the guest room last night,&rdquo; Kayla responded,&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Oh yeah. I think so,&rdquo; he mumbles and stumbles to the coffee machine to make himself a coffee.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">They continue to work on the project throughout the day. Suddenly Kayla remembers she needs to hand in a project the next day. She says goodbye to everyone and leaves in a rush.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Despite their dedication to the project, working on weekends and studying day and night, Kayla begins to feel the strain of the constant grind. As a result, her grades start to decline.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Saturday afternoon and Kayla is in her room studying.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Her phone rings.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Ozzy. She puts her phone on silent and continues studying.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Later </span><span class="c0">she dozes off at her desk.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s Sund</span><span class="c2 c0">ay 11 a.m. and Kayla&rsquo;s phone is buzzing having been set to silent next to her head resting on the desk, causing it to shift ever closer to the edge of the desk. The buzzing stops. Then it starts again, this time causing the phone to fall off the desk with a thud. Somehow that causes Kayla to wake up with a jump. She picks up the phone to see if it still works, and as she does so she accidentally swipes the answer button. Ozzy is on the other side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Are you still going to work on the Project?&rdquo; he asks worried,&rdquo;What is wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Uh, what?&rdquo; Kayla answers, still half asleep,&rdquo;Um, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll call you back later,&rdquo; and she puts the phone down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">After a while the phone rings again. This time it&rsquo;s Zara, &ldquo;I want to see you this afternoon,&rdquo; is all she says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Kayla answers slightly nervously, and Zara puts the phone down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla cleans up and arrives at the mansion. She is shown to a board room where Ozzy is seated. Kayla takes a seat and Zara enters the room. She is wearing a gray business suit with a skirt and a white blouse. She does not look happy. But she is very controlled, a technique she has taught herself which has led to many successes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;ve made some great progress!</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; She says looking at Kayla,&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and I&rsquo;m very thankful for what you both have managed</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;to achieve so far.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">She notices the exhausted look on Kayla&rsquo;s face and posture. &ldquo;But unlike the computers you are programming, we are not machines,&rdquo; she says with a change of tone,&rdquo;and I realize you both have finals coming up. So I suggest you both take a break from the project until after the finals, but if you ever get a brainstorm and have the energy to do it, you&rsquo;re welcome to continue any time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla lets out a sigh of relief. As they say their goodbyes she notices Ozzy&rsquo;s tired posture. They both need a bit of a break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla and Ozzy both get into their studies again with renewed vigor and both of them pick up nicely with their finals results. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla gets back to Ozzy&rsquo;s place after graduation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Congratulations on the Masters degree!&rdquo; Kayla says enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Thanks Kayla,&rdquo; he answers proudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;So what are you going to do next?&rdquo; Kayla quizzes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Still our project, and I&rsquo;m going to get my PhD in Evolutionary and Computational Biology next,&rdquo; he says with a slight grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What? That&#39;s totally different!&rdquo; Kayla looks confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about our project. I&rsquo;m all in and after the universe simulation there needs to be an origin of life simulation as well.&rdquo; he says enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Wow! Okay that is huge.&rdquo; Kayla trails off trying to wrap her mind around what he&rsquo;s trying to achieve</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t have made it if it wasn&rsquo;t for the break we took from the project, &ldquo; Ozzy muses &ldquo;Oh and thank you for your input with your original simulation, It really helped with my thesis&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla is stunned,&rdquo; you used my simulation without telling me?&rdquo; she felt used.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I did make a lot of changes, and it is a project we&rsquo;re working on together. I also credited you for it,&rdquo; he says,&rdquo; I thought you&rsquo;d like the exposure&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla is seething,&rdquo; well thanks for the heads-up!&rdquo; She feels betrayed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I thought you&rsquo;d understand,&rdquo; he says,&rdquo;Remember I actually started the project and you helped me. I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Zara walks in and sees the tense expressions on Kayla and Ozzy&#39;s faces. She senses something is wrong and asks, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Ozzy quickly explains the situation to Zara, hoping she will take his side, &quot;I used Kayla&#39;s simulation as a base for my thesis project, and she&#39;s mad at me for not telling her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Zara looks at Kayla and sees the hurt and anger in her eyes. She says, &quot;Kayla, I&#39;m sorry you feel that way. I know how much you care about the project and how hard you worked on it. But you have to understand that Ozzy didn&#39;t mean to hurt you. He was under a lot of pressure to finish his degree, and he thought you would be happy for him. He also gave you credit for your work, which is more than some people would do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla shakes her head and says, &quot;That&#39;s not the point, Zara. The point is that he used my work without my consent. He didn&#39;t even ask me if it was okay. He just took it and made it his own. How would you feel if someone did that to you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Zara sighs, &quot;I get it, Kayla. I do. But you have to look at the bigger picture. We&#39;re all working on this project together, right? We&#39;re trying to create a universe simulation that could change the world. And we&#39;re doing it with Zara&#39;s sponsorship, which is a huge opportunity for us. Do you really want to ruin that over a misunderstanding?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla is silent for a moment, then says, &quot;No, I don&#39;t. But I still feel like he betrayed me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Zara nods, &quot;I understand. And I think Ozzy does too. Right, Ozzy?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Ozzy nods, &quot;Yes, I do. And I&#39;m sorry, Kayla. I should have told you before I used your simulation. I didn&#39;t think it was a big deal, but I see now that it was. I hope you can forgive me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla looks at Ozzy and sees the sincerity in his eyes. She sighs, &quot;Okay. But don&#39;t ever do that again.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Ozzy smiles and says, &quot;Okay. I promise.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Zara smiles, &quot;Great. I&#39;m glad we sorted that out. Now, let&#39;s celebrate Ozzy&#39;s graduation and our progress on the project. How about some pizza?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla and Ozzy agree and follow Zara to the kitchen. Soon they are laughing and forget about their argument. They are friends again, excited about the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">They start making progress with the project again and as it seems like they are making a breakthrough, the computer they are working on crashes. They had been particularly busy that day, making progress in leaps and bounds. And suddenly it&rsquo;s 1 a.m. in the morning again. Kayla crashes again for the night in the guest room. Kayla and her team had a super productive day working on their project. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Later that morning Kayla is in the kitchen drinking a mocha and her eyes fall on the red rotary car again.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">She needs to clear her head a bit so she goes to take a closer look at the car.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As she approaches the car she sees a man in blue overalls next to the car.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">He has a name tag &ldquo;Robert - Garage Manager&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rob grins seeing her look at the car, &rdquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful car,</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;It is. Lots of power for such a small engine&rdquo; She answers grinning back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Yeah, but it looks like it&rsquo;s been designed by aliens. I have no clue how this thing works. I tried reading up about these but I&rsquo;m afraid to mess something up&rdquo; flabbergasted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s where I can help,&rdquo; Kayla says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I do keep the regular stuff in check though,&rdquo; Robert answers &ldquo;I gave it a service recently when Zara told me about you. It&rsquo;s just the engine. I&rsquo;m not gonna touch it. I will help you though. There are tools and even an engine hoist,&rdquo; he says proudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Cool. That&rsquo;s exactly what I need,&rdquo; Kayla says with a grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Robert and Kayla spend the rest of the day removing the engine from the vehicle. They spend the next week taking the engine apart and cleaning up everything. Kayla replaces the seals and they put everything back together again. Robert just stares at the strange triangle shaped pistons trying to understand how the engine works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Well, she was in a good condition, just a few touches needed,&rdquo; Kayla says looking at the car &ldquo;she&rsquo;s gonna be fine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The next day Kayla arrives at the mansion and Ozzy greets her, &ldquo;Hey Kayla, are we still working on the simulation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Yeah. I just needed to clear my head a bit,&rdquo; she answers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;So is the car running or do you still have some work to do on it?&rdquo; Ozzy quizzes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;She should be fine, but I haven&rsquo;t started her up yet,&rdquo; Kayla responds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Can we try it now?&rdquo; Ozzy asks excitedly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Kayla says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">They get to the garage and Robert is wiping the Rx-7 with a cloth, &ldquo;She looks right and ready, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; Robert says enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla gets in the car and starts it, letting it idle first, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s smooth,&rdquo; she says,&rdquo; When it&rsquo;s mine I might tune it up a bit,&rdquo; she grins mischievously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Zara runs towards them, having heard the engine sounds, &ldquo;You did it!&rdquo; she shouts excitedly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla grins, &ldquo;Wait &lsquo;till you see what I&rsquo;m still going to do with it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Zara smiles brightly and says, &ldquo;This calls for a celebration!&rdquo; They decide to have a barbecue in their backyard. They light up the grill and start grilling tasty meats, filling the air with a mouthwatering aroma. They can hardly wait to dig in.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">As the sun sets, they sit around a small table, enjoying their food and drinks. They chat and laugh, sharing stories and jokes. They have a lot in common, from their love of cars to their adventurous spirit. They toast to their friendship and their achievements, feeling grateful and proud.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Zara looks around and feels a surge of joy. She loves these people, who have been there for her through thick and thin. The barbecue is a simple but meaningful way to celebrate their bond and their success.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After the barbeque as Kayla is about to leave, Zara stops her and puts an envelope in her hand.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Confused, thinking it&rsquo;s a payment for the work she&rsquo;s done, Kayla says&rdquo; I can give you my banking details.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zara is also confused and then realizes what happened,&rdquo;Oh wait, not that! Take a proper look, I&rsquo;m not going to be Zara Swinton anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kayla, confused, looks down at the envelope.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">It is embossed with gold foil with the lettering &ldquo;O &amp; Z&rdquo; and she suddenly realizes it&rsquo;s a wedding invitation, &ldquo;Oh!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Congratulations!&rdquo; &nbsp;she says and hugs Zara. Then stepping a bit back she continues &ldquo; Sorry about the misunderstanding, I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking&rdquo; feeling a bit awkward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No worries&rdquo; Zara smiles &ldquo;you already gave me your details on the first day.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">You&rsquo;ll be getting everything as we agreed, don&rsquo;t worry. Remember, as long as you&rsquo;re working on this project you have a job. I&rsquo;ll take good care of you. Even when the project is finished, I can help you get another position if you need.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ndash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Amidst the tranquil embrace of towering trees, Kayla&#39;s arrival at the charming church ignites a fluttering sensation of anticipation within her.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The slate-roofed stone structure exudes charm, and the joyful atmosphere inside is palpable.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The simple yet cozy d&eacute;cor creates an intimate setting, and it is evident that everyone gathered here knows and adores the couple deeply.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The sweet tones of a string quartet fill the air.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The melodies dance through the room, perfectly complementing the magical ambiance.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Ozzy, looking smart in his crisp white</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;tuxedo, stares adoringly at Zara as she enters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c17">Zara glides down the aisle, the embodiment of ethereal beauty. She has extraordinarily long hair extensions cascading down her back in a mesmerizing display of beauty, reminiscent of a delicate wedding veil. Wrapped in a magnificent white haute couture flounced wedding gown, she exudes an aura of sophistication and elegance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">As she approaches Ozzy, a slight grimace tugs at the corners of Zara&rsquo;s lips, for the weight of her voluminous hair weighs her down ever so slightly. Yet, the moment their lips meet in a tender kiss, it is as if they are lost in their own world, oblivious to the crowd around them. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Cheers and applause erupt as they exit the church, a shower of rose petal confetti cascades upon them, adding a touch of whimsy to the joyous occasion. Hand in hand, they make their way to a shiny metallic pink &#39;59 Cadillac convertible that awaits them. With laughter and excitement, they drive off into the sunset, embarking on a new chapter of their lives together.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Upon arriving at Zara&rsquo;s stunning beach villa, Ozzy chuckles as he carries his beautiful bride over the threshold. As he shuts the door behind them, her skirt gets caught in the door. There&#39;s a rip of an expensive dress, and then there&#39;s the sound of tumbling with laughter and giggling.</span></p><p class="c4 c16"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><h1 class="c7" id="h.bfyx0ryaj7xj"><span class="c0">Ch. 3</span><span class="c9 c12 c0">: Growth</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">After their getaway Ozzy and Kayla are working on the simulation project again. The process is slow but they progress a couple of years on. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla and Ozzy are discussing the project in the study room. Ozzy looks frustrated &ldquo;all this computing power and it&rsquo;s still not enough!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;MiT does have access to the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputer, you know. I can find out what we need to do to get access.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually brilliant!&rdquo; Ozzy&rsquo;s spirits rise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla opens her laptop and searches for the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center website. She finds out that the center provides interactive, on-demand parallel computing that can process large sets of data, create high-fidelity simulations, and develop new algorithms. The center also supports collaborations between Laboratory and MIT campus researchers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&quot;Wow, this is exactly what we need!&quot; Kayla exclaims. &quot;But how do we get access?&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">She scrolls down the page and sees a contact email for MIT campus collaborators. Together they compose an email explaining their project and requesting access to the LLSC system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&quot;Okay, the email is sent. Fingers crossed!&quot; Kayla says.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">They wait anxiously for a reply. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">After a few days, they get a reply from the LLSC staff.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&quot;Dear Kayla Abrahams &nbsp;and Oscar Pratt,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">We are impressed by your project and would like to offer you access to the LLSC system. Please follow the instructions in the attached document to set up your account and connect to the system. We look forward to working with you and seeing the results of your simulation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Sincerely,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">The LLSC Staff&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">They have just gained access to one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&quot;YES!&quot; Ozzy shouts. &quot;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of this myself? Thanks Kayla!&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Zara comes running into the study &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening? What&#39;s all the noise about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;We just got access to one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world!&rdquo; Ozzy says triumphantly, &ldquo;All thanks to Kayla!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow! That&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo; Zara says, &ldquo;So I take it that these computers we have are not </span><span class="c0">powerful</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;enough then?&rdquo; acting in mock disheartenment.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Yeah, sorry Babe&rdquo; Ozzy says and gives her a hug.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">They start following the instructions to set up their account and connect to the LLSC system. They are eager to run their simulation and see what secrets the universe holds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">The project is starting to advance at a higher pace now. They now have a planet with a few buildings. They put Prof. Simmons&rsquo;s AI on the planet. The LLSC system is perfect for the AI and they make advances in leaps and bounds. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">After some time Ozzy gets his PhD in Evolutionary and Computational Biology. After their graduation celebration they are discussing the progress. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;We are progressing, but it feels like we are standing still&rdquo; Ozzy complains &ldquo;Again we don&rsquo;t have enough computing power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there any other supercomputers you can get access to as well?&rdquo; Zara asks.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;There is the British supercomputer DiRAC for universe simulation, but it&rsquo;s in Britain.&rdquo; Kayla answers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll try and contact them. Let&rsquo;s see what we can do&rdquo; Zara answers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">They manage to get approval from Durham University to use DiRAC for their universe simulations. Since DiRAC already does a lot of similar simulations they are able to create good enough simulations in a relatively short time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">But again after a while they reach a critical point of not having enough computing power. The three are in a meeting again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Maybe we should try the most powerful computer in the world next?&rdquo; Zara offers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;We can try that,&rdquo; Ozzy says.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">After going through all the prerequisites they submit their forms and information and wait for the response. They get approved and continue with their work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Now we can get into the origin of life!&rdquo; Ozzy says excitedly since that&rsquo;s what he had been studying,&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s going to be a million times more difficult than everything we&rsquo;ve achieved so far, but I really believe it&rsquo;s worth it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla decides to take a break and work on the car again. She had just been maintaining it until now and she needs a change of scenery. Zara shows up while Kayla is lying under the car.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Hey Kayla,&rdquo; Zara greets Kayla.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla gets out from under the car, &ldquo;Oh hi!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;It looks like this project is really going to take a couple more years,&rdquo; Zara says, &ldquo;Even if this car is in perfect condition, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to drive it any more, especially since you are the only one I can trust with it. I love driving fast cars, but this thing just scares me! &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; Kayla quizzes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving it to you as a gift,&rdquo; Zara explains &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve stuck with us through all these years and I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to have to wait even longer. I will even sponsor any modifications you might want to do, as long as you keep our project a priority.&rdquo; Zara smiles.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Oh thank you so much, Zara!&rdquo; Kayla gives Zara a hug.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Soon the car is perfect. And Kayla starts using it as a daily driver. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been driving that car a lot lately,&rdquo; Ozzy tells Kayla.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Yes, so?&rdquo; Kayla looks challengingly at Ozzy, her hands on her hips.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t those things break easily?&rdquo; Ozzy challenges.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Only if you do it wrong,&rdquo; Kayla says &rdquo;They actually have to be driven a lot to keep them running.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Oh okay, &rdquo; Ozzy grins &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the rotary expert here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Now they are controlling the simulation processes from their study, networked with the three supercomputers around the globe. Ozzy and Kayla continue to work on the project but the origin of life simulation is a whole different ball game. As they try various algorithms, Kayla starts developing an AI that develops algorithms for this problem. Ozzy and Kayla are discussing the issues.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t get any of these algorithms to work&rdquo; Ozzy complains &ldquo;I&rsquo;m missing something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What about that meteorite theory I&rsquo;ve heard about?&rdquo; Kayla offers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;But that would defeat the purpose of the simulation.&rdquo; Ozzy objects &ldquo;Then I want to simulate the origin of the meteorites, which still boils down to the same thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Look I don&rsquo;t know much about the subject&rdquo; Kayla muses &ldquo; but maybe it&rsquo;s something like the conditions were right to develop those meteorites weren&rsquo;t right for creating life, but when they landed it created the right mix? Kind of like Earth was an egg getting fertilized&rdquo; Kayla muses thoughtfully. Then looking embarrassed about the idea of proposing ideas about a field she doesn&rsquo;t know &ldquo;Never mind. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I kinda like that&rdquo; Ozzy answers &ldquo;let&rsquo;s put the meteorite theory in the mix and see what we can get&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I can try and develop an algorithm that will try all these theories and make variations of them with recursive AI generated simulations to find the best proposition&rdquo; Kayla proposes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Great! Let&rsquo;s try that.&rdquo; Ozzy says enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">As time goes by they don&rsquo;t make much progress other than developing better AI simulation systems. And then it happens.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">The computers crash. The simulations have been running at their peak resulting in overheating and crashing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S STILL NOT ENOUGH!&rdquo; Ozzy shouts angrily. He seems to be losing it. He storms out of the study and drives off in his jeep. As he exits the gate and then a near-collision with an oncoming car jolts him back to reality. His heart races, and he eases off the gas pedal. At Carson Beach, where the sand meets the sea, Ozzy parks his jeep. He walks down to the beach and sits on the sand, watching the waves.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Zara gets in her car and instinctively goes to the beach to find him. Without a word, she walks toward him, her presence soothing his nerves. Ozzy meets her gaze, and for a moment, the weight of failure lifts. She sits next to him and puts her arm around his shoulders. He instinctively puts his arm around her waist.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Ozzy</span><span class="c6 c0">,</span><span class="c2 c0">&rdquo; Zara says softly, her voice carrying the weight of their shared struggle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a way. Maybe not today, but someday. Together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">She hugs him. Side by side, they sit transfixed by the ocean&#39;s gaze, lost in its endless allure.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The next day Ozzy notices the news on his phone: &ldquo;Three major supercomputers arou</span><span class="c2 c0">nd the world almost destroyed!&rdquo;. His heart sinks. Zara sees it as well. Wrapping her arms around him she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spoken to Kayla and we&rsquo;re ordering new top of the range computers. As close to a supercomputer as I can get right now. I know it&rsquo;s not Fugaku, but at least you will have the whole system to yourself and it will be a massive upgrade from what we had.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Ozzy nods silently. Looks her in the eyes and kisses her briefly, &ldquo;Thanks Babe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">The next week is spent installing the new systems, Kayla occasionally working on her car. After that Kayla installs the software into the new computer systems. Then she gets into seeing what she can recover.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Fortunately we backed up everything, so we should be able to start again where we were just before the crash&rdquo; Kayla tells Ozzy as they sift through the files, &ldquo;the only thing is, I don&rsquo;t want the crash to happen again, so I&rsquo;ll first write a program to slow down everything if it gets to much for the system. Then I&rsquo;ll see where we can optimize and scale down for now if necessary&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla ends up spending a few weeks getting the simulation working on the new system. They scaled down everything to 10% of the original and now they are able to get it running. But they are stuck again because they can&rsquo;t add anything with the system running at maximum capacity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got good news!&rdquo; Zara says excitedly &ldquo;they have fixed most of the issues on the supercomputers and they are available again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo; Ozzy&rsquo;s face brightens up &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t by any chance blame us for everything?&rdquo; Kayla asks worriedly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Well none of them said anything like that yet, so let&rsquo;s not worry about that. I did take out insurance considering the scale of what we are trying to achieve&rdquo; Zara reassures &ldquo;Plus they are all upgrading their systems with more recent hardware AND implementing new safeguards to prevent this happening again. Which means we will soon get double what we used to have in every area!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">They have an impromptu barbeque to celebrate.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">They start progressing again and the simulation now has a small planet with people and buildings. AI Prof. Simmons is enjoying seeing other people for a change and starts developing very basic social skills. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla and Ozzy are discussing the systems they need to run. &ldquo;Kayla, can&rsquo;t we try to develop some type of fractal system to save memory?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;A fractal system would be slower and use much more memory&rdquo; Kayla answered &ldquo;But maybe we should look into it. I think I might be able to combine it with a form of regenerative AI systems, but it will obviously be a lot of work, as usual&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;But if it works it will be great, right?&rdquo; Ozzy suggests.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I think so. Let&rsquo;s see what we can do. It should advance our system anyway&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">It&rsquo;s night. Zara is sleeping and Ozzy gets up and sneaks out of the house. As he exits the gate an Uber is waiting for him. He gets off at a dingy nightclub. Inside is a lot of laser flashing lights and techno music. Ozzy finds his way to a table in a corner. Seated at the table is a slender man with pale skin. Dressed casually in a t-shirt underneath a lengthy, black trench coat, his dark shoulder-length hair almost hiding his face.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;X?&rdquo; Ozzy asks. The man nods to the seat across from him. They exchange a couple of words and Ozzy hands him a large thick envelope. The man disappears and Ozzy leaves the club to return home.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">A couple of weeks on the LLSC has upgraded their systems and they continue growing the project. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Wow! We have a lot of server space now!&rdquo; Kayla exclaims as she starts setting up everything on the new system. Ozzy smiles &ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Soon after the other two supercomputers have added their upgrades and the project progresses massively.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s going to happen again right?&rdquo; Ozzy tells Kayla.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;The crash?&rdquo; Kayla asks.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;No I mean server space is not going to be enough&rdquo; Ozzy answers</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Yes, we can only do so much.&rdquo; Kayla answers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">O</span><span class="c2 c0">zzy has been immersing himself in extensive research on the field of nanotechnology since the resource constraints demand better solutions. He announces, &ldquo;Combining my knowledge of nanotechnology with my expertise in microbiology has led me to a remarkable discovery. I believe I can create a self-replicating nano-computer!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Kayla&rsquo;s eyes widen in disbelief. &ldquo;That sounds like something out of science fiction, Ozzy! Are you sure you&rsquo;re not losing your mind?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">A mischievous grin spreads across Ozzy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Well, I have created a working prototype at the university. They just don&rsquo;t know about it yet,&rdquo; he reveals, a hint of excitement in his voice. &ldquo;All I need is the necessary hardware to replicate it here.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">As Zara enters the room, she overhears their conversation and immediately becomes intrigued. &ldquo;Okay, give me the information. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do,&rdquo; she says confidently, walking up to Ozzy and giving him a warm hug. Zara wastes no time in taking action. She expands her study, creating a dedicated basement area to house the advanced machinery required for nano manufacturing. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Together with Ozzy, they embark on a challenging journey to develop the system. Years of tireless effort and collaboration finally bear fruit&mdash;they have successfully built a basic physical working prototype. The moment of truth arrives as they place the nanobot in soil. Over time, it displays an extraordinary ability to convert essential elements, such as silicon and iron, into a fully functional computer. Kayla and Zara watch in awe as the nanobot demonstrates its remarkable capabilities. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">However, a new challenge emerges. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s working, but how do we contain it?&rdquo; Kayla voices her concern. Ozzy contemplates the problem, his thoughts unraveling. &ldquo;We need to devise a way to provide it with precise coordinates and ensure it stays within the designated area,&rdquo; he replies, his determination unwavering. The trio knows the road ahead will be fraught with difficulties, but their shared passion and unwavering commitment will propel them forward in their pursuit of groundbreaking innovation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Together they develop a navigation method for the nanobots, so they don&rsquo;t replicate nor move beyond their designated area. They planted the new nanocomputer underneath the mansion. The nanobots built whole server rooms underneath the ground. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By the way, did you hear about the new Moon launch at the Kennedy Space Center?&rdquo; Ozzy asks Kayla.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I really want to go and watch!&rdquo; Kayla says excitedly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well we are going and you&rsquo;re welcome to join us&rdquo; Zara says.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s awesome, thanks!&rdquo; Kayla says excited about the event.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In the early hours of launch day, Ozzy, Zara, and Kayla eagerly arrive at the launch viewing site, their faces filled with excitement.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">In the distance, they can see the spacecraft majestically perched atop the towering rocket, preparations for the launch are in full swing, and an air of anticipation hangs in the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ozzy has worked secretly on another nanocomputer project that he hopes to send to the Moon. Determined to achieve his dream, he has devised a plan to use a microdrone to bypass security and place his project inside the spacecraft.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">While the ladies chat, Ozzy excuses himself, pretending to need to use the bathroom.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Once he is out of sight, he quickly takes out his cell phone from his pocket.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">He quickly accesses a hidden app that allows him to control the microdrone he has carefully concealed in his car.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Guided by Ozzy&rsquo;s skillful commands, the tiny drone zips through the air, navigating around obstacles and security checkpoints.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">It stealthily enters the spacecraft through a small opening and begins making its way towards the designated location.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Ozzy&rsquo;s heart races as he remotely controls the drone, knowing that the success of his project depends on this delicate operation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Zara and Kayla&rsquo;s excitement grows as they watch the launch preparations continue.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">They can&rsquo;t wait to see the rocket soar into the sky and fulfill its mission of space exploration.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Finally, the moment of truth arrives.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The rocket engines roar to life, enveloping the launch site in a thunderous symphony of sound.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The immense power of the engines sends vibrations through the earth, stirring the hearts of those gathered to witness this historic event.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Smoke billows from the rocket&rsquo;s exhaust, creating a dense cloud that obscures the spacecraft from view.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The ground shakes beneath their feet as the colossal rocket ascends into the sky, carrying with it Ozzy&rsquo;s precious project nestled safely inside.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ozzy, Zara, and</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Kayla cheer enthusiastically, their voices joining the chorus of excitement from the crowd. They watch in awe as the rocket disappears into the vast expanse of space, leaving behind a trail of smoke and a sense of boundless possibility.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">In the present tense, the story unfolds as follows:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c6">A couple of days later</span><span class="c0">, the astronauts </span><span class="c6 c0">touch down on the Moon</span><span class="c0">, marking the first lunar landing in decades. As they </span><span class="c6 c0">disembark from their spacecraft</span><span class="c0">, they </span><span class="c6 c0">carefully carry out the new rover</span><span class="c2 c0">, unfolding it and setting it up for exploration. Little do they notice the tiny microdrone that has inadvertently fallen off the rover and landed in the lunar soil.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As soon as the microdrone&rsquo;s advanced sensors </span><span class="c6 c0">detect the unique composition of the Moon&rsquo;s soil</span><span class="c0">, it </span><span class="c6 c0">springs into action</span><span class="c0">. It </span><span class="c6 c0">begins to dig into the loose soil</span><span class="c0">, its specialized mechanisms allowing it to </span><span class="c6 c0">burrow deeper with ease</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In a matter of seconds, the microdrone </span><span class="c6 c0">fragments into millions of minuscule pieces</span><span class="c0">, each connected to each other by thin, flexible wires. These tiny fragments </span><span class="c6 c0">continue to dig</span><span class="c2 c0">, propelling themselves deeper and deeper beneath the surface. As they descend, they encounter a layer of harder soil that poses a challenge to conventional drilling methods.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But the microdrone has been designed to adapt. Each fragment now </span><span class="c6 c0">undergoes its own transformation</span><span class="c0">, splitting apart into strings of millions of nanoseeds. These nanoseeds, each a self-replicating nanobot, possess the remarkable ability to </span><span class="c6 c0">utilize the lunar soil as their primary building material</span><span class="c0">. By harnessing the energy from the surrounding heat, the nanoseeds </span><span class="c6 c0">begin to create exact replicas of themselves</span><span class="c0">, replicating exponentially and </span><span class="c6 c0">burrowing even deeper into the hard soil and eventually into the solid rock beneath</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This remarkable swarm of nanobots is designed to thrive in the extreme conditions of the lunar interior. Their unique engineering allows them to function solely on heat as an energy source, making them capable of </span><span class="c6 c0">reaching unimaginable depths</span><span class="c0">. As they delve deeper, a </span><span class="c6 c0">nano hypercomputer slowly begins to take shape beneath the Moon&rsquo;s surface</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Unbeknownst to the world above, a hidden technological marvel is slowly emerging, powered by the relentless replication and burrowing of billions of nano seeds. The microdrone&#39;s mission encompassing the secretive </span><span class="c0">and remarkable constr</span><span class="c2 c0">uction of a dormant computational powerhouse beneath the lunar surface.</span></p><p class="c4 c16"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c14 title" id="h.raapn7qi2mxv"><span class="c9 c0 c20">Ch. 4 Moonrise</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Zara has called a meeting and she has an important announcement to make. She looks pale and anxious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I have received emails from all three supercomputer administrations asking for reimbursement of damage out of court. Basically they asked us to help them as we can or else they will be forced to sue for actual damages which are in the millions. I made arrangements with the banks and made sure the payments went through a month ago. When I called them today to find out if everything was okay, none of them knew what I was talking about!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What? How?&rdquo; Kayla exclaimed perplexed. &ldquo; If it was one company, I might assume it&rsquo;s an inside job, but three different companies all over the world? No one works for all three of them. Unless-&rdquo; Kayla stops speaking, realizing the next thing she would have said would accuse Ozzy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Everyone freezes. Zara looks questioningly at Ozzy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Before Kayla could voice her suspicions, she clamped her mouth shut. Accusing Ozzy without evidence would be reckless. Yet, the silence in the room screamed louder than any accusation. All eyes turned to him, scrutinizing his every move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Ozzy met Zara&rsquo;s gaze, his expression inscrutable. Was he the puppet master, pulling strings across continents? Or was he merely caught in the crossfire of a grander scheme?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Zara&rsquo;s voice broke the stillness. &ldquo;Ozzy,&rdquo; she said, her tone measured, &ldquo;do you have any explanation for this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">His response would shape their fate. The room held its breath, waiting for the truth&mdash;or perhaps a well-crafted lie&mdash;to spill forth. Ozzy&rsquo;s eyes flickered, and for a moment, the weight of the world rested on his shoulders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">What happened next would determine not only their financial survival but also the fragile trust that bound them together. The supercomputers hummed in the background, oblivious to the human drama unfolding before them. And in that charged silence, the team teetered on the precipice of revelation or betrayal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Ozzy becomes nervous.&rdquo;It was X.&rdquo; he stammers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s X?&rdquo; Zara demands. She was seething.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;The hacker I-&rdquo; he doesn&rsquo;t know where to look. Zara and Kayla are both staring him down.&rdquo;I paid him to hack more space for us on the supercomputers. I still owed him a million-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;What!!&rdquo; Zara is furious&rdquo;What does that have to do with us paying the supercomputer admins?&rdquo; She refuses to believe the conclusions she is coming to.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;I.. I faked the payment system.. He was going to have you killed if I didn&rsquo;t pay him!&rdquo; he stammered.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;No! NO! NO!!&rdquo; Zara is furious. &ldquo;Get out! Now!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Nervously he leaves the room and drives away in the Jeep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Zara breaks down crying on Kayla&#39;s shoulders. Kayla, equally shocked at everything, just sits there on the couch dumbfounded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p></body></html>
