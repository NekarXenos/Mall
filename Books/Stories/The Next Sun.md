I buckle into the control seat of *The Pioneer*, with anticipation. This ship - our first to dare beyond the solar system - hums beneath me like a living creature, the control panels pulsing with streams of data, a kaleidoscope of lights and numbers. The view screen stretches wide. Engineers dart like fireflies, triple-checking the drives. Their silhouettes stand sharp against a sunrise of gold and crimson. A thousand years of dreaming, theorizing, and experimenting—it’s all led to this. Pride swells up in me, a flicker of dread countering it into balance. What if I don’t make it? No one’s left to miss me since the meteor stole them all, and no relationship stuck after that. As long as I don’t die a torturous death due to something accidentally gone wrong.

“Pioneer, initialize startup!” My voice sounds through the cockpit, triggering the ship’s AI.

“Initializing startup, Commander,” Pioneer’s smooth, synthetic voice replies. A low drone ripples through the hull, rising to a steady hum as the systems spark to life.

“Startup initialized, Control. Standing by for launch vector,” my voice echoes in the cockpit, firm against the weight of what’s coming. The glowing trajectory map guides my gaze.

“Pioneer Commander, this is STM Control,” the controller’s voice buzzes through. “Launch vector assigned, altitude gate open. No contacts in your corridor. Cleared for departure - safe journey, trailblazer.”

It’s just me and *The Pioneer*. No crew, no backup. If I vanish into nothingness, it’s one life lost, a small price for progress. They’ll run millions more tests before trying again. But me? I’m not here for safety. I’m here for the rush of the unknown, the chance to touch something no one else has.

I equip my helmet and run the seal check compulsively. It’s perfect. 

“Pioneer, initialise fusion cores” I say, my voice steady despite the excitement inside me. 

“Initialising fusion cores, Commander,” Pioneer responds as the air sharpens with bitter ozone as the fusion core awakens, its low hum vibrating through my bones.

“Pioneer, lift off!” My voice shakes with excitement.

“Lifting off, Commander!” Pioneer announces excitedly, as we lift off, silent as a held breath, hovering meters above the ground. Weightlessness hits - a sensation I’ve tasted in orbit, but here, paired with the drive’s faint pulse, it’s dreamlike. The ship climbs, smooth as a sigh, and I watch the world shrink below: rivers dwindling into silver slivers, mountains softening to smudges. My heart races from awe and the sheer audacity of it all.

The atmosphere thins, blue fading to black, stars piercing the void like needles. My home planet shrinks behind me, maybe for the last time. Our galaxy sprawls across the screen, a glittering smear. I punch the drives to full, and a halo of plasma flares around us, bending light into a shimmering dance. Orbital silence wraps me tight as I activate the main engine. Its pulse thrums in my chest, tugging us deeper into the cosmos.

Under my control *The Pioneer* angle’s the course toward the target star, four light-years away. What could be waiting there? Some alien life-form - or just endless waves lapping lifeless shores of rock? The thought sends a shiver through me. 

“Pioneer, activate micro-warp bubble,” I say after we passed the last gas giant. 
  
“Activating micro-warp bubble, commander.” Pioneer responds cheerfully, activating it with a soft hum. Space contracts in front and expands behind, causing a distortion of reality that sends butterflies through my stomach - stars stretching into blue-white ribbons in front and red-white behind us, time stalling as chronometers flicker frantically trying to keep up. 

Weeks will collapse into moments. The mesmerizing streaks of light make my eyelids heavy. Removing my helmet and reclining the seat, I relax into the calming lull after all the excitement.

During the Alcubierre warp, the ship generates an intense bubble of spacetime distortion. There's a malfunction—a containment breach in the warp field caused by faulty calibrations or unforeseen particle interactions. I, suited up for emergencies, am pulled into the edge of the warp bubble due to a sudden gravitational shearing or some quantum turbulence.

While in this bubble, I don’t experience time or space as we know it—it’s a surreal environment where even moving a finger feels like bending the laws of physics. Equipped with limited oxygen and thruster control, I use quick ingenuity. I recalibrate my suit’s system to align with the distortions, essentially "surfing" the warp bubble back toward the ship. However, navigating the bubble is incredibly complex, requiring a mix of advanced calculations and raw survival instinct.

Finally, after a harrowing journey, I manage to reenter the ship—though with injuries that suggest the extreme stress placed on my body by the warped spacetime. This sets up future dilemmas: psychological trauma, lingering health issues, or newfound knowledge of the dangers of warp travel.

“Commander!” Pioneer raises his volume to maximum,“wake up!” waking me with a start. I slowly open my eyes, blurry with disorientation. I get up to wash my face. Focus. A blue ambient light flashes from the control room.

“Commander, you’re needed in the control room,” Pioneer calls again.

“Yeah-yeah, I’m coming,” I mumble groggily.

Quickly slipping back in the control seat, the screen is alive with information. A message appears, 

“We are entering System 2, Commander,” Pioneer announces. 

“Yes!” I raise my fist into the air. We’ve made it! Screens with data from the sensors show the new solar system with gas giants and rocky planets in orbit around a yellow dwarf star. 

Putting my helmet back on, I run the seal check twice before getting back into the pilot seat. I take control again. Easing off the warp, the ship settles into the local gravity well. A ringed gas giant looms ahead, its blues swirling lazily, its hypnotic beauty absorbing me momentarily. We move on, my eyes fixed on the prize far ahead: 

The Goldilocks planet.

As we get closer I can see a water-blue planet speckled with green and white swirls.

Getting closer, the beauty of the vast shimmering oceans broken by blobs of green landmasses draws me in. Is there life here? My hands shake as I guide us in. 

“Pioneer, can you find an interesting spot for us to land?” I ask excitedly..

“I have found an area with slightly different signals than the rest” Pioneer shows various graphs indicating there’s probably something happening there.

“Interesting, Let’s take a look,” I say, “Pioneer, activate the plasma sheath”

Pioneer acknowledges and fires up the plasma sheath. We slice through the exosphere, riding magnetic currents like a bird on the wind. But as we descend, the green fades to a sickly yellow. Sulfur, maybe, tricking the light? I touch down on a jaundiced plain, the air outside breathable but bitter with brimstone.

I double check that my helmet is sealed. With the camera rolling, I step out. “We made it,” I announce to Pioneer. No-one else will hear me - no-one ever has anyway, not since the meteor.

“This is a historic moment! I am the first of our kind to stand here as my feet sink into the strange dirt of this alien world. This is a historic moment.” I announce, while The Pioneer’s external cameras record video footage of me taking the first steps on this planet. There’s no-one to enjoy it with me, but at least it’s recorded.

The yellow sun glares down, unfiltered, as if the sky itself has been bleached by the heat. The ground before me is a swirling canvas of colour - yellows, oranges, and greens, this is truly an alien planet. The earth hisses and bubbles in places, sulfuric steam curling into the sky. Pools of water, or what looks like water, shimmer invitingly, but I know better than to get too close. Scanning it shows what I suspected - the liquid is more acid than water, capable of dissolving almost anything.

Every step feels cautious, the ground beneath me crusted with mineral deposits, fragile in places. The bubbling pools, the strange formations, the alien colors—it all feels unreal, like I’ve walked into a dream.

There is no sound but the whisper of steam vents, the occasional plop of something shifting beneath the surface. No fauna, no signs of life. And yet, despite the harshness, I can’t look away. It’s beautiful, in a way that defies logic. A reminder of how wild and untamed the universe can be.

There’s not much life here, so I move back to The Pioneer, and lift off again, in search of green areas.

Exploring the planet from the skies leads me to discover that this is only a tiny area with sulfur on the entire planet. That’s why the signatures were so different from the others. Everywhere else is greenery with the exceptions of desert areas. Moving on, I search for an appropriate landing spot. 

I find an expanse of savanna that looks interesting and land my ship on an open yellow grassland area. I step out. All sensors indicate the air is perfectly breathable. I slowly open the visor on my helmet and take a small breath. It’s invigorating with the smell of flora and fauna - life. Taking another deep breath of clean, oxygen-rich air, I enjoy the fresh scenery.

The air is warm but not oppressive, carrying the scent of dry grass, earth, and something wild - an undertone of animals I can’t see but know are out there. The land stretches wide, endless, golden in the sunlight, broken only by scattered thorny trees, their branches twisted like frozen lightning.

I take a step, and the ground is firm but dusty, my boots pressing into the earth. The air is thick with something unfamiliar - oxygen, nitrogen, moisture, and a thousand scents I cannot yet name. Each breath is heavy with particles of organic decay and plant exhalations, filling my sensory nodes with information both overwhelming and intoxicating.

The land stretches before me, vast and golden, covered in fibrous stalks that sway with unseen currents. The ground beneath me is firm but yielding, dust clinging to my feet. Strange growths punctuate the expanse - tall, spindly forms with jagged appendages reaching skyward, their surfaces bristling with defensive protrusions. Plants**,** my database suggests. But they seem more than that, alive in a way I did not anticipate.

A flicker of motion - something small and delicate darts between the stalks, its limbs quick, its body tense with awareness. Further away, larger creatures stand in groups, their patterned exteriors blending with the shimmering heat. They move together, aware of each other in ways my kind does not. A towering one bends its elongated form toward a plant, consuming it in slow, deliberate motions. A herbivore.

The air vibrates with layered frequencies - some distant, some close. High-pitched trills, deep resonant calls, the rhythmic droning of smaller life-forms. Not silence, but a symphony of existence. I close my eyes briefly, absorbing the patterns. This world does not rest. It hums with a ceaseless energy, every piece connected in ways I cannot yet comprehend.

And yet, I am not alone. The sensation is subtle at first, then undeniable. Something watches. Not just creatures of instinct, but minds. Close. Aware. Measuring me as I measure them.

I remain still, adjusting my sensors. The heat, the sounds, the scents, the unseen eyes - it is too much, and yet, I crave more. This world is chaotic. Beautiful. Alive. And I have only just begun to experience it.

There’s movement ahead. Squinting I see a four legged furry creature. I hear another rustle behind me. My pulse rises. Wow! This is first contact! But then the first creature drops, with an arrow in its flank. I spin, spotting a slightly furred bipedal figure - simply clothed with bow in hand. A hunter.

He sees me, and stares with the eyes of a hunter, gazing right through me. He loads another arrow, aiming at me. My fingers twitch to check the seal - but I force my arms down, palms up, exposed as a symbol of peace., I hope he understands.

His eyes lock onto mine - calculating, measuring. An arrow notched, bowstring tight. My heart pounds. Is he aiming at me? A sharp whistle. “Pain explodes. Not the arrow but teeth sinking into my shoulder.” I whirl to see the second creature collapse with a yelp, arrow-struck, its jaws dripping with my suit’s bloodied shreds. A burst of sweet fresh air from outside rushes in through the hole in the suit. This hunter saved me.

The hunter turns and runs as I hear the yelping of another creature approaching. Adrenaline drowns the pain, and I run, following the hunter through tangled brush. While running I check if the suit is sealed. Negative. Of course it's not sealed, my visor is open and the creature had made a hole in the back. Keep running.

Then, beyond the swaying grass, I see more of them.

They are gathered in a loose cluster beneath a sprawling tree, their forms relaxed but their movements sharp, efficient. Their bodies lean and sinewy, their skin weathered by the elements. Some sit on the ground, others squat, a few stand with long, narrow tools in hand. Weapons? Tools? Both? My database flickers with partial matches. Archaic technology. Hunter-gatherer society.

One of them sees me following their friend.

He freezes, his hand tightening around his bow. Others follow his gaze, their quiet conversation fading into silence. The air between us thickens, charged with something I cannot fully process—anticipation, fear, curiosity? My translator struggles, offering incomplete interpretations of their rapid vocal exchanges.

I raise my hands slowly, palms open, universal signals of peace.

They do not run. That is a good sign.

One steps forward. A male, judging by the skeletal structure and my limited biological references. His eyes narrow as he studies me, his expression unreadable. I scan his physiology, noting the rapid increase in his heart rate, the tension in his posture. He is afraid, but not paralyzed by it.

He says something. A string of sounds that my systems cannot yet translate. I tilt my head, a gesture meant to communicate attentiveness. My vocal synthesizer hums to life, attempting to replicate the tonal structure of his language. The first attempt is wrong—the clicks and trills come out distorted. I adjust, try again.

The group murmurs, shifting uneasily. Then - laughter. Not all of them, but a few. The tension eases slightly. My mistake was humorous to them. This is an advantage.

The male steps closer, cautiously, his eyes scanning my face, my suit, the devices at my belt. He lifts his hand and, after a moment of hesitation, extends it toward me. A gesture of greeting? Of challenge? I do not know. But I reach out in return, mirroring him.

Our fingers meet. His skin is warm, rough with calluses. He flinches at the coolness of mine but does not pull away.

First contact.

The others lean in, speaking rapidly, their fear giving way to excitement, to questions I cannot yet understand. The male releases my hand and gestures toward the settlement, an invitation.

I follow.

As I follow the group toward their settlement, I sense a shift in their emotions. The initial fear is fading, replaced by something more complex - curiosity, caution, excitement. More voices call out as we approach, and soon, others emerge from the scattered shelters, stepping into the golden light of the setting sun. Children peer from behind the legs of adults, wide-eyed and whispering.

Then, I see her.

She is different. Taller than the others, her features softer, her hair a different texture, her clothing unnatural—fabric, not animal hide. Her skin is lighter, though still touched by the sun. My AI sensors ping a match: scientific classification unchanged. Genetic variation detected. High probability foreign to this region. So they are the same species, they just look a bit different.

She steps forward, her body language restrained but focused. Unlike the others, she does not hold a weapon. Instead, she holds **a** device - rectangular, smooth, artificial. A tool for recording and analyzing data. She must be an observer. A researcher.

She studies me the way I study her.

I watch as she takes a slow breath, gathering herself before speaking. Her voice is controlled, deliberate, her tone steady despite the tension in her frame. My translator is more effective this time. The words are still fragmented, but the meaning is clearer:

*"Who… are you?"*

I hesitate. Not because I do not know how to answer, but because I must choose carefully. First impressions are powerful, and I sense that **she** is the one I must convince.

I place a hand on my chest, a gesture I hope conveys identity, and speak. My voice is soft, carefully modulated, though my synthesizer still struggles with the alien phonetics.

*"I am… from a different star."*

Her eyes widen. The Hadza around us murmur, exchanging glances. She glances at them, then back at me, her scientific mind already at work, processing, calculating.

*"Not possible,"* she says under her breath, but I hear it.

I take a slow step forward, careful not to alarm them. I lift my other hand, showing my scanner - a harmless tool, its screen flickering with bio-readouts and atmospheric data. I turn it so she can see, hoping she will recognize its function.

She does.

Her breath quickens. Not in fear, but in realization. She understands.

Her fingers tighten around her device, her thoughts racing. Then, softly, almost to herself, she whispers:

*"This… this is real."*

I nod.

“I’m hurt” I say through the translator. 

She looks at me with apprehension. Then looking at the wound, her gaze softens and she beckons me to follow, leading me to her hut. She takes out another device waving it over me, muttering “kijivu”, her fingers twitching against the metal like it’s an old friend. Her touch is gentle, but her eyes stay sharp, dissecting me.

I find myself wondering if she’s doing a medical scan or checking for weapons? Then she looks into my eyes, forcing herself to calm down. Reluctantly she starts tending my wounds, as we trade words, her touch firm and direct. 

Later, the hunter that saved me, brings a meat dish. I eat it, wondering if it’s my attacker, roasted. It tasted quite good, after all the space gel I had been consuming until now.

A week passes, our words weaving a fragile bridge. “Why is the tech gap between you and them so large?” I ask, nodding at a hunter standing guard over me.

Angela fidgets with her sleek device, muttering “kijivu” under her breath. “They’re the Hadza, living like their ancestors—the same species as me, just from a simpler time. I’m from the North, where we’ve got tech like this.” She taps the device proudly. “I study them because they’re healthier—our lab-grown food’s killing us slowly. They’ve got answers we’ve lost.”

She meets my gaze. “Your name?”

“Commander Xalor,” I say, checking my suit’s torn shoulder - habit, even now. “You?”

“Angela.” She pauses, eyes narrowing.

“We’re Xrinth,” I answer

“We’re humans—Homo sapiens,” she retorts, voice tight.

She stares, unrelenting. “What’s this planet to you?”

“Planet 3, System 2,” I mutter.

She smirks. “Original. Figures you’d number a world. “

“My world’s got a name—what’s yours?” she says, her look softens.

“Tzeris,” I say cautiously. “And yours?”

“Earth,” she says proudly. “My home.”

Earth. Unknown to me.

I realise that here on this planet called earth, I’m the alien to these humans.
