# The Abductotron Chronicles of Bob the Grey

# Chapter 1: Bob

A dislocated red button lay on the floor, though “floor” was a rather generous term. This floor was more spherical, and quite offended by the notion of flatness. Nearby, a depressed milk stout bottle rolled aimlessly, but its existence was of no significance. Suspended in disbelief, a silver hammock swayed gently in the ellipsoidal room. A Got Milk poster hovered above mind-numbingly tedious photos of various cow species, arranged on what might be called a wall if you tried hard enough. Suddenly an excited shaft of red light burst from the button with a series of pew-pew sounds, jolted the hammock and dumped its contents unceremoniously onto the floor. It was a little grey - not the doctor - an alien. Just a typical sight on a flying saucer, really. The registration plate on this one read 48DUC707R0N. 

The button zipped up with a racket that sounded suspiciously like “Wakey-wakey, Bob!” This was clearly a misunderstanding. The alien’s name was B08, not Bob. Clad in his least favourite oil slick rainbow pyjama shorts, B08 scowled.

“Ben, I’m B08, not Bob!” The little grey protested.

“Yeah-yeah Bob,” Ben the button teased. ”Time for breakfast!”

The button buzzed its way towards the hammock, which transformed into a floating silver tablecloth beside B08. A hole yawned open in the ceiling, depositing a tin of condensed milk and a sachet of protein shake powder. The cloth caught them with a lazy swish.

“There is no spoon!” B08 grumbled.

“I know,” the button replied smugly.

“Aw, come on,” B08 complained,” how am I gonna eat breakfast now? You’re supposed to be my assistant.”

“There is no spoon,” the button buzzed dripping sarcasm.

Two red lasers shot from the button, ricocheting off the walls and cutting precise holes in the tin. B08 sighed, grabbed the stout bottle, and dumped in the green whey powder, followed by the sticky condensed milk.

“Now what?” he muttered,” how am I gonna stir this stuff?” His bulbous head pulsed with a faint glow of inspiration. He grabbed the button, popped it into the bottle, and plugged the top with his finger. A vigorous shake sent the button spinning inside, its muffled protests blending the mix into B08’s favourite, a thick, neon-green “milkshake”.

“Ahh, that's more like it,” he said, releasing his finger. The button shot out with a pop. B08 tilted the bottle and let the goop glop down his throat. A faint glow pulsated excitedly through his body with a sugar high. 

From somewhere deep in the ship, a faint human squeal echoed, followed by a beep from a floating console labeled “Abductee Quarters” B08 rolled his black eyes. “Same old - same old. I need to change this up.”

“Suit up,” he commanded. The cloth engulfed him in a swirling tornado, reconfiguring itself into a skintight silver suit. The button zipped through the air, landing snugly on the suit collar, still dripping with green goop. B08 wiped the goop off with his finger, tasted it and retrieved his finger with a satisfied plop. His thin lips stretched into what might be called a satisfied smile for a grey.

He walked into the wall, which stretched like dough and reshaped with a plop as he entered the control room.

“Control Room, Status!” he barked, since barking is a normal sound for aliens to make.

“I’m out of control!” Control Room’s distorted voice blurted. Control Room was the brain of the living flying saucer, lovingly named Abductotron. Random social media live streams projected onto the walls scattered like moths looking for a non-existent light to crash into.

“Wh- what happened?” B08 wondered why Control Room was never in control.

“The subject wanted Wi-Fi,” Control Room complained,” and then…” A burst of what can only be described as a little girl’s tantrum cries through a fax machine sound filter,”I’m sorry Bob. I failed.”

“That’s B08!” highly irritated,” and why is everyone calling me Bob now?”” he demanded.

“It was the subject, Bob,” Control Room protested,” she told me that it’s your actual name.”

“Well I’ll show her!” B08 angrily threw up his arms into the air.

In a fit of rage, B08 burst through the doughy wall into an empty containment chamber. “There’s no one here!”

Undeterred, he charged into the next chamber. “Still nothing!”

And the next. “Seriously!?”

By now, B08 was seething. Then, with one final, furious burst, he smashed through the fourth wall, and found himself face-to-face with a young human’s mobile phone camera pointed directly at him.

“OMG! No way!” she squealed, nearly dropping her phone as she bounced with excitement in her white crop top, blue jeans, and spotless sneakers. “I’m *literally* in a spaceship with an *actual* alien! They say his name is B08! Ooooh, one of my followers said that’s leet-speak for Bob! *Bob the alien!* This is insane!”

B08 scowled. “What’s the meaning of this?!”

“Hold up, lemme get a better angle. Your suit is *fabulous*! It’s giving serious intergalactic fashion week vibes. Bob, babe, do a little wave for my followers!”

“I will not—”

"Ooh! What’s this red button?" she exclaimed, with the kind of unrestrained curiosity usually found in toddlers, cats, and people who really should know better.

Before B08 could so much as emit a horrified gasp, she poked it.

There was a *bzzzzt* of the sort normally associated with malfunctioning vending machines and experimental teleportation devices. Then, quite suddenly, she was no longer there.

Instead, she was back on Earth, executing a perfect faceplant into the worn-out carpet of her apartment. Her phone, still valiantly streaming, wobbled in her grip.

Only one person had witnessed the entire event live: a sleep-deprived conspiracy theorist with a username that looked like a failed CAPTCHA and a firm belief that the moon was hollow.

Within minutes, the footage was uploaded to a shadowy UFO forum, captioned with all the subtlety of a neon sign:

**“ALIEN CONTACT CONFIRMED!!!”**

# Chapter 2: The Plan

Back at Control Room, B08 was busy brainstorming new ideas on how to spice up the alien hybrid abduction game.

“Humans are boring,” B08 complained.

“I quite liked that last one,” Control Room mused wistfully. Social media live streams appeared again all over.

“Control Room - you were head over heels in love with her!” B08 laughed.

“I… was...not...” Control Room said with all the persuasiveness of a sleeping turtle.

“She was out of your league,” B08 teased,” she wasn’t into control rooms.” The social media projections vanished into sad nothingness.

Ben the button didn’t like the teasing, so he suddenly overcharged the suit causing him to do a double backflip and land on his face. Fortunately for him, the gravity was set to 0.1 G so it wasn’t as painful as it was to watch. He scowled.

“Sorry Control Room, I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings,” B08 apologised, catching on. ”Let’s run the meditation simulation, maybe I can come up with something good,” as he sat down on the floor and closed his large black eyes.

The lights dimmed. The whole room transformed into a beautiful tropical jungle. B08 started levitating.A babbling brook flowed over white pebbles below him, then into a waterfall and down into a blue lagoon surrounded by coconut palms. He floated on over to the beach with pure white sand and clear turquoise ocean. Dolphins pranced in the ocean. Then the dolphins started surfing big waves upright, to the sound of Surfing USA. A blue whale joined the scene, and crashed the surfer dolphins wave while spouting with glee.

“That’s it!”B08 shouted.  
Immediately the simulation disappeared, but B08 was still hanging helplessly in mid air. 

“Turn the gravity back on please Control Room!” B08 scolded.

Control Room did as he was told. B08 somehow managed to fall on his face again as gravity returned.

“What is it this time?” Button asked with all the interest of a speck of dirt on the floor.

“Space whales!” B08 yelled excitedly.

“But they don’t exist,” Control Room objected, projecting images of every large creature from every planet in his database.

“Not yet!” B08 babbled on excitedly,” You’re a living ship with your own DNA.”

“So?” Control Room felt like he wasn’t going to like this. Or maybe he did, he just didn’t want to like it. Just because Bob.

# Chapter 3: Action

In the middle of the South Pacific ocean a silver disc streaks across the sky. A blue whale lurched through the air knocking the Abuctotron over, and accidentally grabbed it like a dog with a frisbee. It came down into the water with a huge splash, and dragged the Abuctotron under water.

“Maximum spin!” B08 ordered. The Abuctotron started spinning rapidly, causing the whale to spin like a propeller. They flew out the water wobbling like a levitating fly fan. Eventually the whale got too dizzy to hold on and flew off into the horizon. But it didn’t make it, instead it landed with a big splash a couple of hundred meters away, and went down to sulk.

“Did you get the DNA sample, Control Room?” B08 asked excitedly.

“Um kinda sorta, Bob,” Control Room answered, full of insecurity,”It seems the sea water and the spinning washed most of it off.

Just then a humpback whale broke through the water lurching itself into the air.

“Okay Control Room,” B08 commanded excitedly,” tractor beam that whale into space with enough water to contain it and add some air for breathing. Quickly!”

In a flash the Abuctotron zapped the whale. It reappeared in a giant blob of water in space. Beaches all over suddenly became larger as the sea line receded. 

The Abuctotron zipped around the whale taking samples until it was finished.

As they left, B08 had to remind the Control Room to return the whale. It landed with a huge splash and for a moment there was high tide everywhere. 

Down under the ocean, a blue whale and a humpback tried consoling each other. 

“Control Room,” B08 cammanded,” to the far side of the Moon.”

The Abductotron zipped to the far side of the Moon, stopping abruptly throwing B08 against the wall.

“CHRiSPi!” B08 called.

A large white egg shaped CRISPR DNA 3d printing device blobbed through the dough wall and stopped in front of B08 with a wobble.

“Randomise the character creator, CHRiSPi.” Holograms appeared above CHRiSPi showing a variety of Abuctotron whale crossbreeds. One looked just like a silver humpback whale. Another looked like a massive barnacle. The next one seemed to look like a giant silver Blue-whale, so huge the edges clipped out of the room, that you couldn’t get the complete view at once.

“That‘s the one!” B08 was excited,” Set up the external incubator.”

An iridescent bubble appeared on top of the centre of the Abuctotron and grew. It kept growing until it seemed almost half the size of the moon. But actually it was only a quarter of the size.

“This will take a while,”B08 said, “I’ll go and hibernate for now.

# Chapter 4: Event Horizon

#### 

B08 woke up with a start, falling out of his hammock with a face plant. Something didn’t feel right. Was there something wrong with the gravity?

He burst through the wall as was his custom. Button followed, dragging the silver cloth hurriedly to suit up just as he entered the control room.

“What’s going on, Control Room?” B08 demanded. Silence. “Control Room?” B08's voice seemed to echo in emptiness.

“Wha-what happened?” Control Room startled awake.

“Why were you sleeping, Control Room?” B08 asked suspiciously.

“Huh?” Control Room was still busy trying to figure out what happened. “I must have dozed off since nothing was happening. And now… Oh no-”

“What?” B08 looked around worried

Control Room proceeded to project the outside view onto the walls.

“Where’s my Space Whale?” B08 was starting to get angry as usual when things didn’t happen as he had planned.

“Uhm, scans show it’s right here.”

“But I see nothing, Control Room.” B08 scanned the screen looking for maybe a tiny whale. Nothing. Except the stars seemed a bit out of whack and slightly wobbly.

“Overlay your scan data over the current view, Control Room.” B08 commanded with a hint of intrigue.

The scan overlayed the view. Certain parts were recognisable but seemed somewhat disjointed as well as invisible other than warping the view. But the tail was a hundred meters away to one side, while the fins were either side of the ship in the opposite direction.

“Well, it seems a glass Space Whale swallowed the Abductotron.” B08 concluded.

“We are inside the Space Whale, flying saucer and all?” Control Room suddenly felt out of control again.

“Because you weren’t in control as usual” B08 scolded, ”it probably grew around our ship or something”

“It seems I am fused into the Space Whale somehow,” Control Room informed.

“How are we going to navigate this thing?” B08 was perplexed,” open the hatch, let’s see it,” he said as he put on his fishbowl helmet.

As he descended down the blue tractor beam, he noticed he could actually “see” the layout of the whale by the diffraction of the stars, but it was still difficult. His heads up display showed breathable air, so he hitched his helmet to his back.

“Wow this is actually quite trippy!” B08 giggled like a child in a jumping castle.

Back in the Control Room B08 contemplated the new ship. 

“CHRiSPi, make me some shades that add an overlay of the Space Whale, so I can see where I’m going,” B08 commanded. After making a few whirring sounds and blips, CHRiSPi spat out what looked like cheap 3d glasses. B08 donned the shades and went to explore the Space Whale.

---

“Control Room, come in!” B08’s voice had a tinge of worriedness and urgency.

“What’s this time, Bob?” 

“ Uh well-”

“Yes?”

“I’m lost”

“Okay.”

“So do something”

“What?”

“map a way out for me and send it to my shades’ AR display”

B08’s AR glasses proceeded to show a path that looked suspiciously like a fishing knot.

In an effort that took twice as long as it took to get lost, B08 eventually reached the Abductotron.

“Okay let’s just get back to Earth and do another abduction.” B08 said,” I need to clear my mind.”
