Escape from Sol

# Ch. 1: Cirque La Grange

A blue electric arc crosses the dark sky and disappears. The Milky Way looms overhead in all its beauty. Clouds part to the left revealing the massive Moonrise. Slowly the clouds part to the right revealing a beautiful Earth-rise of the same size. But Earth now has silvery planetary rings twinkling in the Sunlight. There is a distant rumble coming from straight ahead. I make out the silhouette of what looks like an ancient Space Shuttle launch, but something is off. There are extra fins at the top of the external tank. Smoke billows into the air and the ship rises up. “Ladies and gentleman,” the ringmaster’s voice declares over the sound system,” Introducing Captain Cruz!”. It’s flying towards us now. A strange sight unfolds. What I thought were the Shuttle boosters are actually SR-71 air-breathing jets on the wings. I also notice the external tank is actually a vintage StarShip like the one that first landed on Mars.The Space-Shuttle separates from the Starship. The Starship flies dangerously close overhead with a thunderous roar, I make out lettering on the underside painted in white on the black heat shield tiles in pixelated lettering “The Martian Maverick”. It continues in a circular trajectory upwards, circling right back to the point where it dropped off the Space Shuttle while large bay doors open, similar to those on the Shuttle. The Space-Shuttle does a loop, folds its wings in mid-air and lands in the Starship cargo bay. The bay doors close, the Starship does another loop and lands on the platform in front of us. A crescendo of music builds up and the final gong sounds, and the display dims out, leaving the crowd in awe at the beautiful natural view of the Moon, the Milky Way, and our home - Earth - without the AR planetary rings. In the centre the legendary Starship stands tall, reminding us of how humans first left Earth for our first planetary visit. ”Two ships piloted by one pilot!” the ringmaster exclaims,” let’s give a hand to Captain Cruz!”

The Martian Starship made me think about the first humans landing on Mars. I find myself wondering how we had managed to populate every part of the solar system in two centuries, yet we haven’t been able to get out of the solar system 800 years since then. Granted, the solar system sized particle accelerator and the solar scoop system has taken all that time to build. If that works astronauts might be able to leave the solar system soon and explore the rest of the Galaxy. 

I look at my complimentary ticket, a transparent card with a nano chip in it that causes my NeuraView optics implants to generate the holographic lettering: “Engineer Albert Ian Grey - Complimentary Entrance to the Year 3000 New Year’s Eve Celebration Cirque LaGrange Grand Opening”. I had designed the safety bubble for the Space Circus, a colossal entertainment complex located at the LaGrange point between the Moon and the Earth where the Moon and Earth look relatively the same size. I must say I am quite amused that they have managed to turn my safety sphere into a massive 10km AR screen. This is a 24-hour-long event that represents the New Year’s Eve of all Earth’s countries. I don’t usually go to events like these but it was a free ticket and I must say I was a bit curious.

A military gentleman next to me starts eating popcorn. His gaze goes toward me. I don’t like it when people stare.

“Are you alright?” He asks curiously,” you look rather pale.”

“I’m fine,” I answer uneasily,” I was born this way.”

I don’t like popcorn. But the smell of his popcorn makes me want it. I turn my gaze to see the popcorn machine not far behind us. That’s weird. It looks like the popcorn machine is warping. It must be the heat from the machine. But that’s not normal heat haze. It’s almost like a bubble forming around the popcorn machine. I need to take a closer look. 
“Excuse me,” I say while moving towards the aisle between seated people. As I get closer the effect seems to disappear. But the popcorn seems to be moving slower than normal.

“Is that real popcorn?” I ask the vendor, but he just ignores my question.

“Do you want popcorn or not?” he asks, rather irritated.

“I’ll have a large popcorn and a sparkling mineral water thanks,” I reply. Now everything seems normal again. Maybe I should have my eyes tested.

I’m back in my seat and enjoying the popcorn while watching the show.

“How did they do that thing where the Earth has rings?” the military man sitting next to me exclaims.

“It’s a ten kilometre dome that they’ve managed to turn into a 3d AR display,” I answer.

“What happens if the dome cracks?” he asks.

“The dome won’t crack, I made sure of that,” I answer,” I designed it.

“Well, now I know who to blame if anything happens,” he jeers.

A tune arises near his ear. His NeuraPhone. 

“Hi. Who is this?” He wasn’t expecting any calls. He listens intently to whatever the person is saying,” Okay, I’ll let security know…”

A loud explosion from behind interrupts his conversation. My chair is thrust into the air. It must have come from one of the food stalls just behind me. As I fly towards the aluminium oxynitride glass dome that protects us from the nothingness of space, I find myself deliriously wondering why he had to ask that. The dome I designed for safety is about to crush me. Well, at least it won’t break and cause everyone else to lose air. I don’t want to die. Suddenly the massive StarShip rushes towards me, spinning wildly on all axes. As it spins around, with the ship about to collide with me, I notice the open hatch on the StarShip. It is getting closer very quickly. Before I have time to think, I find myself flying through the open hatch, landing on a large inflatable clown. My shoulder hits the inflatable with a lot of force. There is a loud bang as the inflatable pops, and a grinning clown face rises above me. The hatch closes. I realise the spin has been totally controlled to catch me in the safest way possible. Pain shoots through my shoulder.

“Welcome to the Martian Maverick!” a voice cracks cheerfully over an intercom. A door slides open, and a grinning bearded guy in his 30’s with shoulder-length brown hair stands in the doorway. He’s wearing a Star Wars-style tunic and cloak. He is obviously dressed for his act in the show. Now he is using his out-of-this-world skills to rescue me.

“Sorry about the clown. It was the quickest thing I could find to soften your catch. Are you okay?” He asks

“I think I dislocated my shoulder,” I reply, “I am not sure what happened. I crashed into this ancient Starship relic, and now I see what looks like a Messiah saving me… ” I grimace, trying to grin, hinting at the way he is dressed.

“And I just abducted an unarmed alien,” he mocks in return, hinting at my alien-like features, “The name is Lee Cruz, pilot and owner of the Martian Maverick.”

Yeah, in school, they called me *Al-Ian* because I looked like a grey alien, being an albino with a large cranium. It doesn’t help that my surname is Grey either. I don’t know if aliens exist, but I intend to find the first one and give them a piece of my mind. Or maybe just join them and hope they don’t notice. Oh, I probably should introduce myself as well.

“Hi, I’m Albert Grey, Engineer,” I feel a bit silly for the long silence before I introduce myself, “Wait, if you’re the pilot, who is flying the ship right now?” I suddenly panic.

“No problem, I have got it all worked out. I just need to be back in my seat in 15 seconds,” he answers and quickly makes his way down the hallway to the control room. 
As my eyes follow him, I see the beams that hold the dome intact getting closer very quickly. In one smooth motion, he jumps into his seat and steers the craft away from the outer dome. 

The next thing I know, the hatch opens again. I never realised we had landed. Cruz has landed the massive Starship in the tightest space with ease at the medical bay. 

Two paramedics enter through the hatch, to help me out. One keeps grinning at me. Probably because an “alien” is sprawled out over a giant inflatable clown. Eventually, they manage to get me onto a stretcher and out of the ship. I see stretchers with injured people being loaded into an ambulance in the distance. 

A friendly auburn female doctor comes to inspect me. 

“I’m Doctor Lea Silva,” she introduces herself, “Does it hurt anywhere?” she asks, poking and prodding me. 

“My shoulder hurts terribly.” I answer. 

“It’s dislocated. Lie still,” she continues, injecting me with some sort of anaesthetic. The pain is gone immediately. She grabs my shoulder and pops it back into place.

“There,” she says,” that should do it. Can you move your toes?”

I try moving my toes, and they feel fine, “Yes. I feel fine now.” 

“Well, get off the stretcher and help then!” She yells at me in mock anger. 

Well, that knocks me out of my state of shock, and I get up to see where I can help. A middle-aged man with important-looking marine epaulettes stumbles into the area. I recognise him as the guy that had asked me about the dome. He somehow manages to look totally confused and in control at the same time. There is a shard of metal embedded in the back of his skull. 

“Hi, where can I get an aspirin?” he asks me. 

“Hey Doc, what do I do with the General?” I ask Dr. Silva, not knowing ranks.

“I’m a Colonel, idiot. Not a General,” the man objects.

“Sorry Colonel,” I apologise.

She walks over to him, “Hold still,” she says, touching the metal piece carefully. She is slightly surprised as it simply falls off. There is a large gorge through the back of his head. 

“There was a piece of shrapnel and I removed it” she says calmly, showing him the shard. One corner is curved as if cut to exactly fit on his head.

“Oh,” he says, slightly confused," I never noticed it. I thought it was just a headache.”

“It didn’t go through the skull,” she says while scanning him,” and your skull is not cracked.”

As she patches him up, he recognises me.

“You were the guy sitting next to me, right?” he asks. 

“Yes,” I nod.

I hear shouting and yelling from the emergency airlock area, not far off.

A lady of mixed race with reddish big dreadlocks wearing a white coat and safety glasses is having trouble with the security, “I need to see Colonel Han immediately!” she insists while the security is trying to constrain her.

Then the unfolding emergency scene catches her eye. She falls to her knees and cries “Oh no, it’s too late!” and starts sobbing.

The high ranking officer walks towards her “Professor Reed?”

She looks bewildered. “It’s all a big mistake!” she cries “Are you arresting me?”

“No, I’m Colonel Han. You called me earlier to warn about this.”

She relaxes, relieved to have found the person she is looking for.

“Oh thank goodness it’s you, colonel!” No one wants to believe me when I tell them this would happen” she exclaims “And then after the explosion they think I was a terrorist” she breaks into sobbing.

“My apologies,” he says, “I was about to inform security after you called me. But the explosion stopped me, and then it was too late anyway.”

“But I still need to contain it!” she exclaims, “Just a moment while I get my containment device” running back to her little ship.

She pulls out a large metallic cylindrical device from the ship. It has a built-in screen showing the location of the device.

“Do you mind if I tag along?” I ask, very curious, “I’m Albert Grey, the engineer that designs the safety bubble for this place.”

“Er- okay, you might be useful or something,” she says, eyeing me cautiously “ I’m Professor Jane Reed.”

“The explosion is behind me right over there” I say as we reach the area, pointing at a red mesh of twisted metal that used to be a popcorn machine,

As we get closer I notice popcorn floating in the air, but we still have gravity.

“That’s strange” I say, becoming cautious about getting closer.

“Don’t get any closer,” she warns us, “ this is very dangerous.

I notice a warping of the light around the area resulting in a magnifying effect as well as a dimming of light towards the centre. A slight buzzing fills the air, but I can’t pinpoint its origin other than it has to come from the anomaly. Or else I am having a severe case of tinnitus.

“Is that like a mini black hole or something?” I ask cautiously.

“Something like that,” Jane says, pointing the device toward the anomaly and touching the screen. The front end of the device clicks open in a jaw-like action and a mechanical claw protrudes slowly out of it with a series of clicks and whirrs. She cautiously moves closer. The claw moves out with a hiss and a click, clasping onto the anomaly which seems stuck in that point in space. With a grunt she grabs hold of a handle on the other end of the cylinder. The device is hanging between her grip and the anomaly. She pulls a trigger on the handle and the outer cylinder slides forward with a hiss in a piston-like movement until it encases the anomaly and clamps the mechanical jaw shut. Suddenly the device drops to the floor with a heavy thud. And the popcorn drops as well.

“Hmm, you guys are useful after all,” Jane says with a grin, “I’ll need you two to carry this back to my ship,” while she takes a closer look at the popcorn and carefully collects every piece of popcorn that has floated into a specimen jar.

Between me and the colonel, we barely manage to carry the device that she has previously carried with ease. Whatever that thing is inside the cylinder has some very strange properties. First it is floating and now it is extremely heavy.

“What is that thing in there?” I ask confused. I have not seen such a thing anywhere, and being an engineer, I would have expected to at least have heard about this kind of phenomenon, “I just can’t fathom what could have caused such an explosion.” I say, stunned at everything that has happened these last few hours.

“It actually started 10 years ago when I was doing my Masters thesis. I think I have come across a Nobel Prize-winning discovery that could create wormholes by creating a ripple in the time-space continuum. While experimenting with the phenomenon, it looks like it is working and then suddenly everything disappears.”

“So what does that have to do with the Space Circus?”

“At the time, I had set up a laboratory right here at the L1 Lunar Earth LaGrange point; there was no Space Circus back then.”

“But that was ten years ago. Are you saying your experiment time travelled?” I ask, shocked at such a realisation.

“I have run countless simulations and variations of theories and they all point to that exact time. I’m onto something big. Very big.”

“But also very dangerous, it sounds like to me”

“Exactly. That’s why I need to contain it. Maybe even try and destroy it in the Sun if possible”

“It would need that much energy to destroy it?” I am amazed,” I would love to help with that. If you want, that is,” I offer, somewhat uncharacteristically.

“Thank you, I appreciate that.” She looks at me, and we exchange NeuraPhone contacts on our NeuraView screens.

We wave goodbye as her craft leaves the emergency bay. She is barely a kilometre out when we see a flash of light from her cockpit and the craft abruptly shuts down, leaving it floating out into space.

“Did you see that? We have to help her! Who’s with me?” the colonel shouts.

“What happened?” Dr Silva asks, hearing the commotion.

“Her ship shut down or something,” I shout, “Quick, let’s get into the Starship!”

“Hey! What are you all doing in my Starship?” Lee Cruz asks, confused as everyone piles into his Starship.

“There was an accident outside the emergency bay,” the colonel answers, “Take us there immediately.”

“Okay, ‘Commander’, commandeering my ship,” Cruz answers with a grin and a mock salute.

As the Starship approaches, Cruz matches the speed and direction of the craft, getting as close as possible. He locates the emergency hatch and aligns the Starship’s docking port, clicking into place. Then he selects emergency manual mode and opens the hatch. Cruz has a whole closet full of space suits that he lets us pick and choose from to wear for this rescue mission. Cruz goes in first, checking to see if there are any air leaks or damage to the craft. He quickly calls for Dr. Silva to go in and check up on Jane Reed’s condition. They return, carrying Jane on a stretcher.

Moments later we manage to create a makeshift medical bay. It looks quite good, actually. Replicator tech these days is limitless, and Cruz’s is very fast.

Jane slowly opens her eyes. She smiles and closes her eyes again. The medical instruments start beeping and showing all kinds of strange readings that don’t make sense.

There’s a strange thud coming from the hull of the ship and I can feel the Martian Maverick speeding up, creating the effect of gravity.

“Well, it looks like this is not going to help us now,” Dr. Silva says, “It seems the anomaly is affecting our instruments. We’ll have to do this the old-fashioned way.”

“Cruz, I think we need to get as far away as possible from her ship. That device seems to be affecting all our instruments,” I suggest.

He nods and proceeds to adjust the controls. Then, for the first time, his expression changes to a very serious frown.

“No!” he shouts, “It has already affected my ship. There’s nothing I can do now.” He is perplexed.

“Can you remember the last projected route?” Colonel Han asks.

“Yeah. That’s part of the problem.”

“Where are we headed?” Dr. Lea asks. She is getting jittery.

“The Sun,” Cruz says blandly.

“That could actually be useful,” I try being positive, “Jane said we need to destroy it in the Sun.”

“Does anyone's NeuraPhone work?” Dr. Lea’s face goes pale as her NeuraPhone is not responding.

No one’s NeuraPhone works.

“I don’t see any instruments on, so how come we have artificial gravity in this ship?” Colonel Han asks.

“We are continuously accelerating,” Cruz answers, ”that’s what’s creating the gravity effect. There’s no such thing as artificial gravity.”

“I don’t get it,” I ponder, “we are at the LaGrange point, how do we go from stationary to hurtling towards the Sun in such a short time?

“Well, can you see Earth?” Cruz points towards where Earth has previously filled the view through the windows. Now there is just a small blue speck that is getting smaller and smaller. I watch as Earth becomes a tiny blue spec.

“How can we be moving this fast?” I ask, perplexed, “Nothing can go this fast!”

I look out the window and see Jane’s craft still attached via the docking port.

“That craft is pulling us towards the Sun” Cruz says, perplexed “But its engines are off. It makes no sense.”

“It must be that anomaly somehow” I blurt, “When I was questioning Jane about it, it sounded like it is almost as powerful as a black hole, maybe dark matter or something. There is some weird gravitational stuff happening where she retrieved it at the origin of the explosion”

“Enough!” Colonel Han orders “We need to get a solution. Albert, you say you engineered the Space Circus, maybe you know of any stations we might get into visual contact with along the way?”

“Space is huge Colonel, the only thing we’ll get close to before the Sun is maybe an asteroid or two.” I say, discouraged.

Dr. Lea interrupts, “Wait, isn't there something in the news about something being built on asteroids near the Sun?”

“Yes but that’s a railgun that shoots hydrogen fuel scoops into the Sun and it’s still experimental” I answer. But it makes me start wondering if there isn’t a way to use it to our advantage.

“But you may be onto something” I continue, “There are a hundred asteroids that have been moved into close orbit around the Sun. On each one there is a device that’s basically a railgun that will shoot a frozen tungsten scoop into the Sun’s photosphere to gather hydrogen to refuel starships. If we could gain control of one of these, we might be able to use it to scoop up Professor Reed’s ship and send it straight into the Sun. But then someone would need to reach there before us and we are already moving faster than any ship before…” I throw my hands in the air in dismay and flop into my seat.

“Well I don’t like the sound of that,” Dr. Silva chirps in, “What if this ship blows up? Then we’ll all be gone!”

“Maybe Professor Reed would know what to do, since she made that thing,” Colonel Han says, “Do you have any progress on her, Dr Silva?”

“She seems to be in some kind of trance-like state, but I don't know why she would be in such a state. I don’t know too much about trance states except the little bit I learned about hypnotherapy, but this is beyond my expertise,” Dr. Silva sighs, “plus I could lose my licence if I do it wrong.”

“This is about survival right now, so we need to give everything we’ve got, “ Colonel Han reprimands, “Get her out of that trance now. That’s an order!”

Dr Silva seems to wake up from her own little self-pity trance and with determination she resumes trying to help Prof. Reed.

“I might have something that can help in the cargo hold,” Cruz announces, “Follow me,” he says as he makes his way to a door.

He opens the door to reveal what looks like an ancient spacecraft.

“This looks like the Space Shuttle from a millennia ago,” I say, very intrigued.

“Yup!” he answers, ”One Space Shuttle gutted and upgraded. I have had it modified to a manual backup for a power-out stunt for the Space Circus, but now it might be the most valuable thing we have. Depending on if we can pull it off.”

“This must be like a thousand years old,” I say as I stare in awe at the relic.

“Just about, yeah,” Cruz grins, ”I renamed it to Explorer. Not as exciting as The Martian Maverick, but I’d like to go exploring the moons of Jupiter with it some day”

“I see the wings fold up, unlike the original” I observe.

“Yeah. I love restomods,” Cruz laughs, “also, I had to figure out a way to make it fit.”

“Can we use it to move the Starship away from Dr. Reed’s craft?” Colonel Han asks.

“We’re going to have to do this without any automated help,” I say, worried that this will end very badly.

“And if we don’t try, we all die,” Colonel Han reminds me.

“Okay Al, I’m going to write down a set of instructions for you and the Colonel to follow, while I take the Space Shuttle out,” Cruz says matter-of-factly.

“But I’m no pilot,” I protest, “I use auto-pilot on take-off”

“The more flight-oriented stuff I’ll hand to the Colonel. You’ll do the more technical stuff, okay?” Cruz is getting irritated with my jitters.

“Okay.” I am relieved. It is a bit more in my territory.

“I’ve been keeping up with our emergency flight training, so I’m good with that.” Colonel Han says enthusiastically.

“For all we know, the systems might wake up once the anomaly is away from the ship,” I muse, “though at the speed we’re going, I’m not sure how big a field of influence the anomaly has.” I am starting to gain hope.

“First we need to try and separate Professor Reed’s craft from my StarShip,” Cruz says thoughtfully.

We double-check our space suits and make our way to the docking hatch. The hatch looks like it is made from molten aluminium foil due to all the stress from the connection. The airlock behind us is closed.

“I think we should cut the Professor’s craft from the other side, just to minimise damage to my StarShip,” Cruz says as he hands me and Colonel Han a cutting torch, taking his own and stepping through the hatch into the craft.

“Sounds good to me,” Colonel Han says as he follows him.

“Might as well make the best of it,” I say as I follow suit.

“I suggest we start cutting out a star shape around the docking port, leaving the corners intact,” Cruz says, “then we can see when the ship starts tearing apart and get back in quickly.”

As we start cutting through the craft’s hull, air starts escaping. As I am cutting, the hole I am making starts ripping further, tearing in two directions. I could control one tear but two is dangerous. I panic.

“We got to get back in quick!” I grapple my way quickly through the docking hatch as metal starts tearing. But a shard of metal rips loose, hitting my helmet right in the visor,leaving a scratch that makes it impossible to see. I let out a yell. Cruz cuts the shard with his cutting torch and pushes me back in through the hatch. We make it just in time. Professor Reed’s craft rips loose from the StarShip and is flung towards the now very large Sun, while we grip the safety rails to prevent getting sucked away with the ship. 

I suddenly notice how large the Sun has become.

“Oh my…” I freeze, “We’re very close to the Sun already.”

“Quick, everyone use your torches to try and weld these metal shreds together to close up this hatch” Cruz orders. It is strange to see him suddenly giving orders, “I want to save as much as possible of this StarShip intact”

The metal is still soft and hot, allowing it to bend, but we can’t touch it for too long without it burning through our gloves. With slow and steady progress, we manage to weld the hatch closed to the best of our abilities.

We open the airlock and quickly close it behind us, just in case. Cruz goes to his pilot seat to check the controls.

“No power yet,” he says, disappointed as he watches the shredded small craft fly on ahead of us.

“That thing is still accelerating, but it still has an effect on this ship,” I note, “strange.”

We act quickly. The more we can get off course, the more likely our survival will be. Cruz writes down instructions for us and proceeds into the Shuttle bay. We have to use manpower to open the outer bay doors. It feels like forever, just trying to get the doors to move, but we manage to get one door open. And then the next door. Next, we tie down the front landing wheels with chains. And then we hoist the rear of the ship so the thrusters point upwards at an angle. It has to clear the back wall behind which the Starship’s engines are. We do our best to secure the ship into position. It must be a strange sight from outside - a StarShip with half its body opened up into two curved flaps on the sides with a Space Shuttle piggybacking at an angle. It probably looks like a Space Shuttle crashed into a StarShip.

Now we aren’t concerned with the Solar Hydrogen Scoops anymore. We just have to try and stay clear from crashing into the Sun. And hope we have enough Fuel in the Space Shuttle to manage that at the speed we are going. And the quicker we get off course from the Sun, the greater chance we have of making it.

We watch as Cruz starts the Shuttle’s engines. Rocket flames burst into life, jolting the ship sidewards. We all cheer through our microphones as we feel the effect of the ship starting to move in the right direction. But we have no instruments to tell if we are going to make it or not. We will just have to go on visuals for now.

After half an hour of thrust from the Space Shuttle, the tanks are finally empty. It only had a little bit of fuel in it for the circus show; he hadn’t planned on taking a trip to the Sun. We just have to hope it worked.

Cruz has quite a lot of food on the StarShip. I am beginning to get the idea that he lives in this thing. I estimate that we have a week to go before anything becomes critical. We just have to ration ourselves and hope for the best.

One day later we are all sick with worry. Our course seems to be for the edge of the Sun. We need more power, but no-one's ideas seem plausible. Me with my big head, being a brilliant Engineer, can’t figure out anything under the terrible thought of ending up burning in the Sun.

# Ch. 2: Sunshine {#ch.-2:-sunshine}

A day later we are all huddled together, watching the horizon of the Sun getting closer.

“What’s that?” Dr. Silva points to something in the distance.

I immediately recognized it.

“It’s the asteroid with the Solar Scoop Railgun,” I say, realising grimly that we are heading its way. Death by crashing into the asteroid seems to be a better option than burning in the Sun. I shake the thought. “We have to move now!”

The asteroid fills our view very quickly with imminent contact. 

“We’re going to crash!” Doctor Silva cries out in distress.

Suddenly there is a flash from the Sun.

“What was that? Could it be Professor Reed’s craft with the anomaly?” I ask

“At the speed it keeps accelerating, very possibly,” Cruz replies.

“She’s back!” Dr. Silva shouts and suddenly the lights come on. 

Cruz immediately takes control of the ship to try and steer clear of the asteroid. We watch as the edge of the railgun on the asteroid misses us by millimetres. Cruz is calm and in control. I sigh in relief.

Professor Reed sits upright with a big grin on her face, and Doctor Silva lets out a shriek of joy.

“Cruz, do we need more Hydrogen? We need to act now if you do,” I look earnestly at Cruz for an answer, as he studies his MFD display.

“Yes, send a request and see if we can get that Sun-scoop Railgun thing to work!” Cruz shouts while dodging the large asteroid, fighting with the controls.

I am at the controls trying to contact the Solar Hydrogen Scoop system within a fraction of a second. Seconds feel like hours. The Solar Hydrogen Scoop system is one of many asteroids with a massive railgun installed, orbiting very close to the Sun. It is loaded with a large hollow cylindrical scoop. The scoop is made of tungsten and has a thick carbon shield to protect it from the Sun’s heat. On top of all that it is magnetically frozen for even more heat protection. Once fired, it will skim through the Sun’s atmosphere, scooping hydrogen from the Sun to refuel the Starship.

“We have access,” I shout excitedly.

“Go! Go! Go!” Cruz shouts back.

“We’re syncing,” I say, relieved.

The Solar-Railgun nav-system works out a path and syncs. The nav-system sends procedures to the Starship to get it to slow down since they have to be the same speed to be able to latch.

There is a flash from the railgun as it shoots the hydrogen fuel catcher towards the Sun's photosphere.

Suddenly the StarShip starts turning towards the Sun.

Dr. Silva lets out a shriek, “what’s happening? It looks like we’re going towards the Sun again!”

“It’s just the RCS turning the ship around so we can use the rockets to slow down so we don’t miss the scoop,” Cruz smiles calmly. She lets out a sigh of relief.

The Starship continues turning until it faces back the way we came from. Now we are flying backward. The rockets fire up again, attempting to slow the ship down as much as possible.

I get to work at building latches to catch the scoop using Cruz's replicators. Even though we are going at insane speed, the Sun is huge and I manage in time. Meanwhile Professor Reed is excited about the destruction of the anomaly. Using one of Cruz’s smaller replicators, she creates scientific equipment to study the Sun and the effects the anomaly has on it. It is probably the only chance she will have of studying the Sun this close, so she uses it to find out as much as she can.

“Well it definitely got absorbed into the Sun. There is a bright spot with off the charts energy readings,” Professor Jane Reed says excitedly.

Tension fills the cabin as we anticipate the hydrogen scoop’s arrival. We all know what’s happening, but we can’t see it yet. The scoop is entering the Sun’s atmosphere at incredible speed, scooping up hydrogen, while most of the outer carbon layer disintegrates. Then we see it on the screen, resembling a comet flying straight at us. I flinch instinctively.

“Captain Cruz,” Han orders “Make sure we’re aligned!”

“Yes, Commander!” Cruz deftly aligns the ship, matching the trajectory. He fires the rockets one more time to merge their speed. 

“Al, deploy latches!” Han shouts excitedly.

I deploy the latches. “Hydrogen Scoop Latching deployed, Commander!”

There’s a loud thunk as the scoop connects with the latch, followed by the sound of liquid nitrogen cooling the device.

“We did it! Hydrogen intake cooling initiated. The fusion reactors will fly!” I announce excitedly.

“Good work, team!” Commander Han thanks everyone, 

“So Cruz, “ I ask, “what are the chances of getting back to Earth now?”

“Not without exiting the Solar system first,“ Cruz says while studying the projections, “ We couldn’t even land on Pluto at this speed!”

“Ooh that sounds interesting!” Professor Reed says excitedly, “Hmm… What about Port Exodus?”

Cruz’s eyes stretch wide with disbelief, “What? Why do you want to go there?”

“If we reach Port Exodus at these kinds of speeds we might just be the first humans to exit the Solar System,” Reed starts rambling.

Colonel Han and Doctor Silva didn’t know what she was talking about. But Cruz and I knew. Port Exodus was created to experiment with wormhole travel to distant solar systems.

“What about supplies?” I object

“We have replicators, silly,” Reed laughs, ”I’m sure it’s easier getting matter for the replicators on board than to try and land somewhere at these speeds”

She was correct. We could easily gather matter from asteroids with magnetic trajectory fields.

“But no-one has ever left the Solar System!” I objected.

“Cats and dogs have returned safely,” She continued.

Cruz’s sense of adventure kicked in, “I’m in!”

“What are you all going on about?” Colonel Han demanded.

“Professor Reed wants to send us to another Solar System through the experimental wormhole at Port Exodus,” I explained.

“What?” Colonel Han was shocked. Doctor Silva’s face went pale.

“Well, it’s either that or we wait 100 years to come back to Earth,” Cruz said, looking at alternative routes.

“Why are you doing this to us?” Doctor Silva started tearing up, “ What’s going to happen to us? Are we all going to die in a wormhole?”

No one has ever left the solar system. Scientists are busy with tests, but progress is slow and no-one wants to be held responsible for sending some-one to another solar system and not returning, not knowing what happened to them.

After some back and forth we all realise, there’s not much else we can do. Or maybe it was the stress of the situation. We just couldn’t come up with an alternative.

Since communications are back, Colonel Han contacts his base and informs them of the situation, asking for any help getting to land on Earth or elsewhere. After many emergency meetings and discussions with the biggest minds in the solar system, no-one could agree on what to do and how to do it.

“Well then,” Colonel Han announced, “We shall explore the universe!”

Colonel Han, Professor Reed and I all contact the relevant people that we have come across in our careers to prepare for the Wormhole jump.

”Next up, gas giant slingshots!” Cruz said eagerly.

As we sail away from the Sun, the scoop trails behind us like a comet’s tail. We go on toward the cold void beyond the solar system. There is a primordial black hole that has been hiding just outside our solar system, ready to send us to far away systems waiting to be discovered. The Martian Maverick sails on into the infinite darkness.

# Ch. 3: Surfing Giants {#ch.-3:-surfing-giants}

After a couple of months Jupiter starts getting larger. Having been around the Sun, Jupiter feels small compared to Sol. As we get closer, we cannot help but stare at the swirls of gas clouds as if hypnotised. Jane takes to the telescope, and starts exploring all the interesting swirls. A yellow moon comes into view, Io, resembling a mouldy orange.

“Now that’s one place I never want to go,” I ponder while watching the sulphuric volcanoes spout into the air on the viewscreen as Jane zooms into the camera view.

“Fortunately we don’t have to go there,” answers Jane, “Though I really hope we have something better than this waiting for us on the other side.”

We leave Jupiter behind and reach Saturn. Once again we are all in awe of the beauty of this majestic ringed planet. We can see Titan looming in the distance, as well as a welcoming committee of light crafts awaiting us, creating the effect of a night runway lined with their ships on either side. Though this “runway” is more than 10 kilometres wide for safety’s sake.

“Welcome to Saturn!” the voices of the Titan crew rings across the radio.

We all smile at the festive welcome party of the Titan crew. That has to be every ship in their fleet to be visible to us.

“Thank you so much for such a warm welcome, Titan Crew,” Commander Han radio’s back to them, and everybody cheers.

We don’t get to see much of the fanfare since we are going at such a high speed. As we approach the rings our path flows from slightly above them, though the loop between the planet and the rings down through the other side. This will get us in the right direction towards Port Exodus.

“We’re threading the needle, Commander,” Cruz chuckles.

—

After a year of travel, we approach Port Exodus. It is hardly visible, save for the solar powered LED lights and the spinning tetrahedral mirrors reflecting what little of the Sun is still visible. As we approach I can barely distinguish the row of lights going off into the distance to our left and right. The port took a little over 200 years to construct. It forms a ring in orbit around the sun at 50 AU which is a little further out than Pluto. Asteroids were taken by robotic spacecraft to the outer limits of our solar system and placed in a circular orbit around the Sun. This is not a Dyson ring to harvest solar energy, as it is obviously too far away from the Sun for that. Their purpose is to collect energy for a solar particle accelerator 50 au in diameter, that sets particles accelerating around the Sun and smashes them at Port Exodus. 

Humanity first built this with the hopes of creating a wormhole, but it was unsuccessful after many attempts. Eventually it was used to further particle studies. It was also a new place to set up telescopes to explore the Universe even more. 

And then they found it: a primordial black hole just outside our solar system. With new hope for a wormhole all particle accelerator projects were put on hold to try and create a controllable black hole that would merge with the primordial black hole and possibly create a wormhole. There were many theories, but they had to be put to test. 

Eventually they managed to create miniature black holes and miniature wormholes that connected to the primordial black hole. As time went by they managed to create a bigger wormhole and finally they managed to create one that could take a starship. After many years they managed to get a robotic spacecraft back from the other side. Eventually even rats came back in perfect condition, bringing hope for humanity to explore the Universe personally.

Now it is our turn. No-one on this ship has been to Port Exodus before. We stare at the blackness of what we cannot see. Jane turns on the holographic overlay showing a vaguely saturn-like shape of the black hole visualised in 3d vector lines.

We get closer to the port. We are now all wearing our full space suits. We are all strapped in. If anything goes wrong, we will automatically be put under sedation and revived when it is safe, an ingenious system devised by Doctor Silva. My heart is in my throat. I feel like I want to get off the ship and wait on this base for the next ship to take me back. I can’t, we’re moving too fast for that anyway.

“Engineer Al Grey, synchronise the particle accelerator with our ETA!” Commander Joe Han’s voice breaks through my thoughts.

Recentering my thoughts, I activate syncing on the console, “Sync activated, Commander.”

“Everyone, fasten your seatbelts!” Commander Joe Han shouts.

We are all very tense, not knowing what to expect.

We get closer. I can feel everything getting heavier. Everything is starting to look warped. I try not to get overcome by the heavy gravity, by doing high g-force breathing and exercises. The protective gravity bubble is working, but there are still some slight side effects of the process. Everything is still black. The holographic display just doesn’t seem to make sense anymore. Nothing makes sense. Nothing even looks real anymore. Now would be a good time to stop the simulation and get us out of here. But it’s not a simulation. It’s real. And now it’s starting to feel even more real than everything else out there back on Earth and in the Solar System. 

I can hear Dr. Lea’s breathing becoming heavy. Then she starts gasping for air, even though her vitals are showing fine on the screen in front of us. And then there’s a beep signalling that she is getting sedated.

I'm slightly worried that our only medic is the one that is sedated, but I need to concentrate on getting there intact myself. I also don’t want to miss anything. Yes it’s hellishly scary, but it’s also just as exciting. We are surfing the galaxy into the unknown.

I glance at Jane. She is really excited. She doesn’t want to miss anything either and is straining herself to stay conscious and experience it all.

Just as I start to feel like this is the end, I see a distant light. Is this the light at the end of the tunnel? It must be a star. It’s a star and it’s getting bigger very quickly. But then it seems to envelope our ship and I realise it’s just the bent light from a star that we are travelling towards. Eventually we exit the black hole. We are moving at the same speed we left the solar system, but we seem to be slowing down for some reason. Maybe we should be able to navigate to some planets relatively soon, if there are any.

I quickly set up a probe that will relay our safe arrival back home. There is a mini particle collider in the ship for this exact purpose, which also was used to create the gravity bubble. As I adjust the particle accelerator I reminisce about how far this technology has come. Just ten years ago, nobody thought we would be able to achieve this level of atom smashing in such a small device. A beep notifies that the device is ready and the probe disappears into the black hole.

We all check on Lea and it seems that she will be fine. Next Jane runs a preliminary scan and telescope sweep to see if there are any planets. I struggle to take it all in. We are in a totally different solar system, light years away from home. Will we find a habitable place and set up a base? Or will we have to go back empty handed?

# Ch. 4: Discoveries {#ch.-4:-discoveries}

“I’ve scanned this solar system and we have one planet in the goldilocks zone,” Jane says excitedly.

As we study the planets in the new system, we discover at least one methane gas giant twice the size of Jupiter and then there is a rocky planet with water in the goldilocks zone.

We plot our way using the gas giant’s gravity to steer towards the planet and we all take a well needed rest.

The next day I wake up to see Jane sprawled over her desk searching frantically through notes and formulas.

“Morning Jane, What’s wrong?” I ask.

“I think I know why we are slowing down so quickly”

“Well that’s a good thing isn’t it?” Commander Han had just got up as well.

“Well yes and no,” Jane is shaking, “We might not even reach the planet.”

“Why?” Commander Han queries.

“The anomaly is in the hydrogen scoop. It seems to be drawn back to the black hole that we just emerged from.”

“Okay so we can get back to Earth?” Dr Silva had heard the noise and also woken up.

“Well yes. That would be the good news. But what if we don’t get any footage of any planets here?”

“You know what? You’re crazy!” Doctor Silva was getting irritated. “First you create this thing that could probably have destroyed all of humanity for all we know.” she says, looking Jane straight in the eyes. Jane is visibly shaken by this statement. 
“Then you send us out into the middle of nowhere, but you don’t care if we get back home or not. You just want to explore and probably blow us all up in the process!” Dr. Silva stormed out and went to her sleeping quarters.

We decide to each think it all over and meet again in a few hours to see what we can come up with.

After many calculations and much deliberation we realise we can plot a course that will take us close to the planet and use the Space Shuttle to land on the planet while the Starship goes for another close encounter with a sun giving us about a year to explore and return to the Starship and then back to the wormhole, if everything goes well.

Months pass and soon the blue gas giant comes into view. It is twice the size of Jupiter which helps us slingshot to the rocky planet. In passing we notice a moon that looks very similar to Venus. Passing in between the massive blue gas giant and the cloudy moon gives a surreal sensation of clouds and blue sky in an upside down kind of way.

# **Ch. 5: Earth 2.0?** {#ch.-5:-earth-2.0?}

A year passes and the goldilocks planet comes into view. We see white planetary rings around the blue Planet roughly the size of Mars. There’s a lot more water than on Earth with a few scattered green land masses and many cloud formations like twisted galaxies. The largest land mass looks about as big as Australia in proportion to the size of the planet. It looks so much like home, yet so different.

As we near the planet, we pass close by its first moon. My stomach churns at the sight of the moon's yellow sulphuric lakes, geysers, and volcanoes spewing ash into the sky, creating a dark and ominous atmosphere. Above the churning clouds, flashes of volcanic lightning illuminate the scene.

"Worse than Io," I mutter, "the mere sight of that moon makes me queasy."

We couldn’t see the second moon clearly but scans showed it to consist mostly of water.

We had packed as many replicators into the Space Shuttle as we could. The Shuttle’s RCS jets rumbled and with a jolt we left the StarShip, set on autopilot around the star.

As we approached the blue planet, there was an eerie sense of uncanniness as it looked so much like Earth, yet so very different.

We decided to land on New Oz as we called the larger land mass. We notice what seems to be a largish open area that would be good to land, next to the ocean. Everything is green. As we get closer, it looks more and more like Earth. It looks just like a tropical jungle, just a bit more turquoise than green. The area we choose to land on has hexagonal basalt like formations surrounding an area with slate rock.

Cruz guides the shuttle in a manoeuvre that would have been impossible with the original Space Shuttle. Using current technology on a craft with a thousand year old thrusters seems to be one of his “things”. As we descend, the craft rotates so that it lands vertically, ready for the next take-off. 
Jane starts testing the atmosphere to see if it is safe to breathe.

“Hmm 35% oxygen in the air and the rest is mostly nitrogen, but humidity is very high,” Jane Reed announces with a smile after reading the test results.

“We’ll still need our space suits or some kind of mask,” Dr. Silva interjects, “that is too much oxygen for us. And suits will help regulate the humidity. Also we need to decontaminate ourselves and everything in this ship,” Dr. Silva hands each one of us a nano pill that will clear us of anything that could contaminate life on this planet and puts up nano aerosols all over the ship.

“Well that’s a bummer,” Cruz grunts with a grin, “I was just about to go for a swim.”

“It does seem that there are life forms but nothing close by,” Jane continues analysing the data, “I guess we probably chased a lot of them away simply by showing up here.”

I decide to hand out multitools to everyone, “These will probably come in very handy,” as I show everyone how it works. It’s a cylindrical device attached to a wristband with a few touch sensors and a holographic display. “It can be a cutting tool,” I say as I select the option on the menu. A blue blowtorch flame appears,” as a blowtorch or as a laser,” with the flick of a switch it changes to a laser beam and I immediately switch it off,” of course you have to be very careful with the lasers in the ship so you don’t destroy anything. Also don’t start any forest - or should I say jungle fires.”

“Next there is the tractor beam that magnetises just about anything and can help you carry stuff,” I say as I select the tractor-beam and move a box into the air and put it down again,”You can also use the tractor beam to absorb material for replicating. Yes, there is a limited basic replicator function that can duplicate small object shapes with whatever material you give it. It’s basically a 3d scanner and 3d printer in one,” I say, focussing it on dr. Silva’s stethoscope and then focusing it on the table and within a few seconds a plastic replica of the stethoscope appears, “It will use whatever material you absorb with it”. There is also a replicator function that will create the necessary materials from whichever material you store in it, but that usually takes too long to be practical”

“Oh and they are all radio linked, so you can use it to call for help,” I explained,” I am setting up a radio signal so that we can use our NeuraPhones to call each other, but it’s good to have a backup>”

Cruz loved the multitool. He kept flicking the blow torchon and off like a bored child playing with a lighter.

We go down into the cargo bay. Cruz had modified the ship with a small door in the cargo door, just above the tail fin. Under Cruz’s controll a retractable ladder with side railings unfolds along the tailfin and down onto the ground. He had also made vertical landing gear so that the craft could land vertically, as it is now.

We exit the Space Shuttle and set foot on alien soil for the first time, while Dr. Silva records this momentous event on her NeuraVision Cam. While Cruz cheerily quotes the famous words, “One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”

Doctor Silva suddenly freezes, her eyes wide with fear, “There’s something behind you!”

We turn around, but see nothing.

“What did you see?” I ask.

“I’m not sure,” Doctor Silva is shaking.

We look around. It is difficult to look for anything different than normal since all the plants look different from those on Earth, yet with many similarities.

I find myself staring at the trees near the beach. They resemble palm trees but their leaves hang in drapes almost like a weeping willow. The long drapes combined with the arc of a normal palm almost resemble green wings. I think I ‘ll call these Angel Palms. 

Nearby I notice a small tree stump moving, but then I realise it’s not a tree. It’s a large insect. It looked like an iridescent dragonfly with clear butterfly-shaped gold-tinted gossamer wings.

“It’s a giant butterfly?” I say out loud to my own surprise.

“It’s beautiful,” Dr. Silva says, and starts recording video footage of the creature with her NeuraCam.

“Hmm, it seems to have that butterfly type mouth. I think it’s called a proboscis or something. ” Professor Reed says, studying the creature from a distance. 

“So the butterfly mouth sucks nectar,” I ponder,” but a mosquito also has a mouth like that.” I freeze.

It starts flying towards us. 

“Maybe if we stay dead still it won’t notice us” I say, holding my multitool ready in case it does attack.

Fear takes over doctor Silva who, ignoring me, runs back to the Space Shuttle.

We watch as it flutters to a large plant that resembles something like a giant orchid with petals shaped like a Delicious Monster plant. Its iridescence reflects beautiful rainbow colours in the gossamer wings. It lands on the petals and starts sucking up the nectar. We breathe a sigh of relief.

# **Ch. 6: Contact** {#ch.-6:-contact}

We decide to go and do some recon, but doctor Silva decides to stay by the ship. Further down the white beach we see a lagoon and decide to explore from there. It almost felt like going on holiday to a tropical island, while wearing an air conditioned space suit. The lagoon is beautiful with cyan water. A waterfall falls gracefully into the lagoon. We go further into the jungle, up past the waterfall, following a babbling brook with white pebbles.

Everything is eerily beautiful. So many things that look like they are from Earth but always with a twist.

I notice something that looks like a white rabbit.  
“Huh, I thought this planet was in the Carboniferous period, but this looks like a mammal,” I say softly.

“Look! A nest with blue eggs,” Professor Reed points to a nest in a thick blue grass-like patch.

The “rabbit” pounces, spreading out its paws like a flying squirrel with a membrane between its legs, steering it directly into the nest with a large fluffy tail I hadn't noticed.

“It’s a long-eared flying squirrel,” I laughed, ”Is it going to eat the eggs though? Or maybe it’s a type of nut?”

“Anything is possible in this place,” Professor Reed laughed.

The rabbit eared squirrel starts putting the eggs into its marsupium-like pouch.

“Wait, maybe it’s a miniature flying kangaroo!” I start laughing, ”Is it going to eat those eggs?” I wonder.

“Well if it’s a monotreme like a platypus, it could have eggs,” Professor Reed noted, ”So it’s a monotreme marsupial or something.”

“It’s a flying Easter Bunny!” Cruz roars with laughter. We join in the laughter as the flying ‘roo flies off with its hatch.

Suddenly it drops to the ground. A blunt arrow falls close by. Civilization. 

“It seems there may be hunter-gatherers here,” I whisper.

“No need to whisper now,” Colonel Han said, ”They already heard us laughing.”

We wait in anticipation to see what kind of alien might show up. Maybe they’ll look humanoid since everything else seems relatively Earth-like.

“Whatever they are, don’t let them get a hold of your multi-tools,” Colonel Han warns, ”rather show them some other low level tech, we don’t want them weaponizing our tools if they’re still at hunter gatherer stage.”

I jumped when I saw it, even though we were expecting an alien to appear. 

A cyan-skinned argonian-like reptilian humanoid appears from the foliage, steadily aiming a flint arrow at Colonel Han. 

We all freeze. It’s roughly the height of a small person about 1.5 metres. I notice it has a large frontal cranium and huge black eyes with flat slit-like nostrils and a small slit-like mouth, much like the mythical Greys. The legs are digitigrade with two very flexible toes in front and one in the back, gorilla-like yet reptilian. The hands also have only two fingers and a thumb.

The alien observes each of us intently. Last of all it stares at me. It almost looks like it recognises my “alien” looks compared to my companions. It lets the bow down slowly, still ready to attack if necessary.

“Al, it seems to trust you more, give it some of your snacks,” Cruz advises softly.

I slowly take a bag of biltong dried meat from my pocket and take out a piece for the alien. I hold my hand out with the piece of biltong in my palm. It doesn’t move. I decide to put the biltong on the ground and move back cautiously and sit on the ground. The rest follow suit and sit as well. It still doesn’t move. A split tongue starts flicking in and out of its mouth, just like a snake does to smell. It slowly approaches and picks up the biltong, studying it from all angles, flicking out its tongue more frequently. Then as it opens its mouth the tongue flicks out again, snatching the morsel into its mouth in a split second. The alien stands still for a while and then holsters the bow over its shoulder and puts the arrow into his quiver.

It turns around to pick up its kill. I notice it has a small tortoise-like tail.

Professor Reed takes to recording this interesting creature on her NeuraCam.

It turns around, and stares at us again. Its skin-colour starts changing like a chameleon into a very human-like skin-tone. I get the feeling this creature doesn’t feel threatened by us, even though it is probably confused. It seems to be trying to welcome us by matching our skin tone, if that makes any sense.

It holds out the rabbit towards us and then holds it to its left as if trying to gesture to us to come and join in the meal at its place. 

“I guess it’s inviting us for a meal,” Professor Reed says, mesmerised.

“Let’s go then,” Colonel Han says, ”We might need them as allies, and they might help us to understand the environment better.”

We follow the alien through the jungle. I notice a group of small monkey-like reptiles swinging through the trees above.

We reach a small clearing next to a vertical rock face at the foot of a mountain. There is a cave hewn out of white rock, but the entrance is about half a metre off the ground surface.

The alien stands at the entrance and calls into the cave. Its voice sounds very much like a whale’s sound. More whale sounds emerge from the cave in a beautiful symphony of sound and another alien emerges. This one is already the same flesh colour that the first one had changed into. It seems they are very good at communicating colours to each other. It sees the ‘roo catch and squeals with delight - or at least that’s what I think it was. It takes the catch inside. The first alien makes a dance-like gesture beckoning us to take a seat on low-slung branches that had been tied during growth in a hammock-like shape to become a very comfortable seat. 

As we take a seat, I notice what looks like a gigantic beehive higher up the edge of the mountain, but I don’t see any bees. Our host seems to notice me recognizing the hive and calls into the cave again.

Our host points at his chest and makes a sound I can only describe as a whale trying to say “Zyratth” in a sing-song tone. He repeats the process.

“It’s introducing itself to us,” Reed says and using her best singing voice tries at pronouncing “Zyratth” correctly. We all join in giving it our best shot and then start introducing ourselves. It was at this point that we stopped using titles like colonel or professor, it just seemed tedious. The alien has trouble with the consonants, but manages to make sounds that we can recognize as close enough for our names. Jane Reed is documenting everything with her NeuroCam excitedly.

The other alien emerges with pottery bowls shaped like butternuts. Zyratth introduces her as “Nyrovaa”. 

Nyrovaa sets the dishes down in the middle of the clearing, indicating that we can choose which bowl to take.

We carefully take the bowls and curiously try to discern the contents. It looks like caramelised dried chicken strips. Zyratth and Nyrovaa take the remaining bowls for themselves.

Zyratth lifts the dish closer to his face, opening his mouth revealing his reptilian teeth and split tongue which lashes out into his bowl, grabbing the morsel and retracting it into his mouth. He gulps it down in a typically reptilian manner. 

I decide to open my visor, so I can eat. Immediately I feel the heat and high air pressure on my face, but it’s bearable. The extra oxygen seems to make it more bearable in a sense. I pick a morsel from my bowl and take a bite. It’s crunchy and sweet on the outside and salty on the inside. “Hmmm, it tastes like honeyed dried bacon, “ I say, guzzling the rest down. Our crew watches me wide-eyed as if expecting me to drop down dead. 

After a while the others relax and start eating as well. We needed that after our long trip anyway. I notice one of the large butterflies flying up to the beehive and enter. 

“”Looks like the honey is made by the butterflies,” I note.

After the meal, Zyratth makes another whale-call into the cave and a magenta-skinned alien emerges carrying a very pale looking baby alien that is making dolphin-like sounds, whom they called “Kaeloon”.

“Why are they bringing a baby out to strangers like that?” I wonder aloud.

“Maybe the baby is sick and they’re hoping we can heal it?” Jane suggests. 
“Maybe we should get Doctor Silva here then,” Joe Han says.

“How do we explain that to the aliens?” Cruz asks.

“Well let’s videocall Lea and show her the baby and see what she says,” Jane says.

We video call Lea and show her on screen to the aliens, gesturing that she is the one to help and that she is at the ship. Their expressions seem blank, but they also seem to be expecting something good to happen. 

“It’s too far to carry the baby, since we don’t know what the issue is,” Jane says.

I get an idea,” Lea, can you send the replicator blueprints for any of the medical tools needed to scan the baby for diseases to my NeuraPhone? I can hook it up with my multitool and maybe scan or something while you are on your way here. You’ll get a marker on your NeuraVision with the route we took and Jane will send videos of the areas we were so you can double check your route.”

Lea agrees and sends the files.

After some time, I manage to replicate the tools. By this time Lea is halfway there. We follow her instructions and the aliens allow us to scan baby Kaeloon, looking expectantly at us. Lea had also said we should scan as many other aliens as possible as well and another reptile as well if we can. They are all too willing although they obviously wouldn’t understand what we are doing. They also have a pet that somewhat resembles a miniature T-Rex called Vorlith, that with enough coaxing from its owners eventually allow us to scan it.

The scan analyses the creatures and compares its DNA with known creatures on Earth and does an automatic comparative analysis.

Lea arrives out of breath. She is overjoyed with being able to help. After doing a physical exam as well she gives baby alien Kaeloon an injection of nanites that will heal her based on her DNA.

For some reason we feel we can trust these creatures, even Joe Han trusts them. They seem highly intelligent for their stage of civilization and never showed any signs of force or violence toward us.  
Zyratth points in the direction toward the beach making gestures and sounds I could only interpret as quizzical. 

“I think they want to know about our ship,” Jane says.

Joe Han nods. Lee Cruz is excited to show off his ship to these cave dwellers and we all set off back to the ship.

As evening approaches I notice the volcanic moon with glowing red lava veins throbbing all through the moon split in half by the lines of the planetary rings. Scary visions of sulfuric geysers and lava rivers cloud my mind. 

We reach the ship and Lee talks to Zyratth about his ship, even though they couldn't possibly understand what he is saying. But Zyratth is enjoying the show and watches Lee with interest as he chatters off, staring in awe at the wonderful devices we have on the ship. Zyratth leaves for home after the ship tour, and we lock the ship and prepare for a night’s rest.

I struggle to fall asleep with visions of the volcanic sulphur moon clouding my thoughts. I decide to let my speakers play the live sounds of the sea outside and drift off into dreams of going for a swim in a sulphur lake and trying to dodge lava splashing overhead.

# **Ch. 7: The Dragon** {#ch.-7:-the-dragon}

The sunrise wakes me up through my porthole window. Beautiful hues of red, orange and blues flood into my bunk. I sit up and go to the porthole staring out at the beautiful scenery. There is an eerily beautiful crescent-like rainbow split in the middle by the planetary rings.

And then I realise what it must be - the water moon we never saw. I stand there transfixed for probably an hour, watching it set while the sun rises, with a beautiful display of colour and light.

I get dressed and go to the kitchen. Lea is having a cup of mocha that smells very tempting. Lea looks worried.

“There’s a crowd of aliens outside,” she complained,” I hope nothing went wrong with my medication. I can’t face them now.”

“Is there anything you were unsure of during the medication process, Lea?” I asked.

“No,” she said.

“Well then I doubt it’s that,” I look out through the window at the slate area. There’s a very colorful crowd outside, reflecting the colour of the setting moon I had been entranced by earlier.

“I’m going outside,” I announce,” You can stay and keep watch of the ship again if you want.

After suiting up I find the rest of the crew waiting for me, also all suited up.

Cruz opens the door, Jane immediately starts recording the scene on her NeuraCam. The small crowd outside makes various whale-like sounds and quietens down. They change colour from the colorful rainbow colours they were to skin tone. They seem peaceful. Their large black eyes follow us, examining our appearance as we descend.as we reach the bottom, I recognize Zyratth waiting for us. He makes a few circular dance-like movements along with a few whale calls and announces each of our names as we disembark the stairs, the aliens echoing each name softly. 

A child is brought before us, obviously also sick. Zyratth makes a loud whale-call and calls out his best rendition of “Doctor Lea Silva”  
The crowd echoes the name in a beautiful sing-song way.

“I’m sending that last bit to Lea,” Jane says excitedly, ”it looks like they need her again.”

Within minutes Lea is with us, helping the child. 

“He ate something poisonous,” Lea says. She removes a poisonous berry from his stomach and stabilises him.

A crescendo of whale-call music arises from the group of thankful aliens.

A sudden loud screech breaks the cheer and a large red Pterosaur-like creature appears flying above the trees. It has stegosaurus-like plates on its back and tail ending in two large spikes at the end of the tail. Its head is shaped more like an alligator than a pterosaur and it has a lot of teeth. It looks a lot like a wyvern.

The crowd scatters and we follow suit. Climbing back up the stairs would make us an open target.

We follow Zyrath into cover under some large turquoise beech shrubs between the angel palms. 

“I think the ‘dragon’ doesn’t like the presence of the ship,” Cruz comments.

The wyvern dragon looks like it’s taking a deep breath in preparation for an attack. In one sweep it blows a 360 degree ring of what must be some kind of supersonic boom that just about blows the trees over. The Explorer falls over from the wind. My heart sinks. That was our way out of here. And right now it just changed from paradise to hell. I notice Zyrath taking out an arrow. One of the other aliens makes a loud click sound and suddenly it’s raining arrows into the dragon. Most of the arrows hit in the heart and lungs, but it’s still flying. Another loud click and a second swarm of arrows hit it, this time they were all aimed at the wings. The creature plummets and falls to the ground with its tail hanging over the fallen Space Shuttle. It makes a hissing sound directed toward its attackers. I notice the aliens shielding their airways as the creature blows its last breath over them. The creature twists and turns and crashes into the Explorer. Another loud click and a third wave of arrows directed at its head eventually kills it.

Lea and Jane scan the creature to see what information they can get from this creature.

Loud dolphin-like sounds rise up from the aliens as they do a victory dance making dolphin sounds. They all celebrate and start slicing it up. They start a large bonfire on the open slate area and prepare a feast. A lot of the meat gets set aside to take home, while the rest becomes a massive barbeque. The feast lasts all day as they celebrate their victory over the dragon. We join in the feast. 

“It tastes like chicken,” Cruz laughs,” - with a hint of crab. These aliens really know how to make a delicious meal. I would never have thought I would ever eat Pterosaur meat, let alone dragon flesh!” We all laugh. Everyone is having a great time.

Zyratth introduces us to their leader, Vornak, who welcomes us warmly.

In the background the fallen Explorer lay with its nose in the sand and its tail in the air, the rear resting on the basalt rock.

“How will we ever get back?” I ask,” I hope Cruz’s replicators can handle the repairs needed for this.” I’m devastated.

Zyratth notices my constant glancing at the ship. He gestures to us to go with him after the feast.

We follow him back to the cave as sunset approaches. When we reach his place he continues further along the foot of the mountain and we reach another hewn out cave. Noises are coming from the cave and a large plume of dust escapes the cave entrance. An alien pokes its head out carrying some sort of hand-made broom, sees us and goes back in. This one seems shy. After a few whale-calls from Zyratth, two aliens exit the cave, make gentle dance manoeuvres and leave. Zyratth enters and beckons for us to follow. As we enter I notice the white rock is somewhat like quartzite. How did these people manage to cut into such a hard rock? As we go deeper through the passage I realize the place is well lit without any artificial lighting. Looking up I notice conical ceilings that seem to lead to a chimney of some sort. It must be some sort of natural ventilation as well as letting in light and dispersing it around each room. Zyratth shows us two straw beds in one room and three beds in another, and gestures that we are welcome to spend the night there. 

Well, at least I don’t have to watch the scary moonrise now. Tomorrow we’ll have to see what we can do about the Explorer. It has lived up to its name up until now.

# **Ch. 8: Change is here to stay** {#ch.-8:-change-is-here-to-stay}

I wake up, disoriented. Where am I? Oh yes, I’m in an alien cave. This straw bed really confused me for a moment.

The sunlight coming through the “skylight” seems to be quite strong. It must be quite late already.

The others are already up it seems. The sunlight is intense as I step out of the cave. The rest of the crew are all relaxing in the tree chairs.

“At last, Al!” Cruz cheers.

“You sound pretty cheerful for someone with a broken ship,” I note.

“It’s been fixed a million times!” Cruz laughs, ”My replicators can do it with their eyes closed.”

We make our way back to the ship. Cruz sets up the replicator sequence. First mobile replicators are created. They start from the nose repairing and alternating with creating more replicators as they move towards the back. By the end of the day the ship is fixed. Cruz puts the craft in hover mode and sets it back on the slate, only this time, horizontally like an aircraft.

“I think it will be safer this way,” Cruz explains, ”I think it really ticked off that dragon thing.”

We need to stay here for a year so we decide to try and learn the language of these aliens so that we can better communicate with them. We dub the aliens “Chamaliens”. Jane uses the footage of the aliens from our NeuroCams and compiles a language learning programme to load onto each of our NeuraPhones. It is a bit hit and miss in the beginning especially since there are some tones we can’t reach but eventually we manage to communicate in broken alienese. 

We try to learn of their culture which I find very strange, none of which makes sense to me. One thing I could make sense of was that they very much believed in “Do to others what you would want them to do to you” and had a very Zen-like culture. We learn to just accept that they do things differently and leave it at that. What is very interesting is that they know their moons are spherical and know when certain features on the Hell-moon will be visible.

The year is almost over and we have a wealth of data on this interesting planet and its people. I wake up to another beautiful sunrise moonset and decide to take a walk on the beach. The sand is fine and white with clear turquoise ocean lapping gently at it. 

A glint in the sky catches my eye. It’s getting closer very quickly. It can’t be. It flies to almost above my position, abruptly changes direction at 90 degrees and zips off over the inland. A flying saucer? Really? Who’s going to believe me? 

Whether they believe me or not, we have to act quickly. We don’t know what their intentions are. And if they do look like the proverbial Greys, the locals could be very gullible since we’ve been so good to them. When I reach the ship the rest of the team is already onboard. Everyone has seen it, except Colonel Han. He doesn’t believe us at first, but when he realises we weren’t all together and saw the same thing from different places, it sinks in.

“We have to warn the locals,” Colonel Han decides.

We decide to go to the tribe leader first, warning whoever we encounter along the way. We first see Zyratth and try to explain to him what is happening. 

Colonel Han approaches Zyratth, ”Greetings Zyratth. Did you see that thing in the sky?”

“Yes Han, we saw it. Was it the StarShip you had been talking about?” Zyratth puzzled, ”It looked a lot different from your craft that landed.”

“No, it was not from our kind,” Han informed,” Our planet might have encountered these before for over a thousand years and yet we still don’t know anything about them.”

“Do you know what they look like?” Zyratth asks.

“If all accounts are correct, they have very light grey skin and facial features very much like your people, but their legs are more like ours.” Han says.

Zyratth ponders, probably trying to imagine what they look like. Then his gaze drifts toward me. “Do they look like Al?”

My face goes red.

“It seems you can change colour like us as well, Al?” Zyratth asks curiously.

“That’s about as much as we can change colour,” I say defensively, ”when I was young, the other children used to say I look like a Grey alien, but I had nothing to do with them.”

“Well now that you mention it,” Han continues, ”They probably look a lot like Al.”

“And we’re not 100% sure about that either, since there are many rumours, but no clear evidence,” I interrupt.

“What’s more important is what they might do to us,” Han continues.

“What will they do to us?” Zyratth is getting confused.

“We don’t know,” Han is at a loss of words.

“There are rumours that they take people up in their ship, ”Cruz interrupts,” Some say they were medically examined and then returned.”

“Oh, like Doctor Silva?” Zyratth asks cautiously, trying to understand what is going on.

“No. It seems they sometimes hurt the people and make them forget things,” I answer, “ But come with us and you might be able to explain to the others quicker than we can. We will explain more along the way.”

He joins us as we continue explaining what we think is going on. Eventually he gets the gist, since we were their first alien contact and the Greys might have been our first alien contact and considering all the rumours we have heard about Greys, we should all be a lot more careful than the locals had been with us.

We reach the village centre. Their leader, Vornak, is addressing a small crowd that has gathered. Obviously everyone has seen the flying saucer and are enquiring about what it is.

“May we speak with you privately, chief Vornak?” Colonel Han asks,” It’s regarding another ship.”

“Is it about the silver disc we all saw flying across the sky earlier today?” chief Vornak asks.

“Yes, and it is very important that we discuss it,” Colonel Han says.

Vornak waves the crowd to disperse.

Suddenly everything is bright white. I can’t see anything.

I drift away into darkness.

# **Ch. 9: Abduction** {#ch.-9:-abduction}

I hear voices. My mother’s voice. But it’s distorted. No it’s not a voice. It’s the sound of machinery or tech devices. I’m uncomfortable. I can’t feel my legs. I open my eyes. Bright light forces me to close them again.

I slowly open my eyes again, trying to adjust to the light. I make out another form on an examination table next to me. I’m quite sure it’s Vornak. A figure is looming over him. It’s a Grey alien! It has the silhouette typical of a Grey alien, the spotlights reflecting off its large deep black eyes while it’s studying Vornak intently. Am I on the UFO now?

I feel the senses I had just regained draining from me as I slip away into nothingness…

..I have to fight it..

With all the strength I can muster, I fight against whatever drugs they are pumping through my veins. I take deep breaths, trying to get as much oxygen as possible into my bloodstream.

I fade out still fighting…

I slowly regain consciousness. All I know is that I have to fight this. Deep breaths. I slowly feel more in control and more conscious. I can feel the drip in my arm. I hear the clinking of vials and weird warbling voices that sound like reversed sound recordings. I can see two bobble-headed Greys huddling around equipment and screens. They’re not close by anymore. I have to get this I.V. drip off. 

I start rubbing my wrist against the strap that is holding my arm down, pushing the drip against the strap. One of the Greys stops for a moment and looks in my direction. I freeze, quickly closing my eyes. I wait, trying to breathe deeply without showing it. I hear the clinking of vials and alien chatter again. I almost pass out again. I take another deep breath. And another one. I slowly open my eyes. The Greys are still engrossed in their experiments, or whatever it is they’re doing. 

It’s now or never. I thrust my wrist outwards while pulling my elbows up, forcing the I.V. drip hard into the wrist strap but it slips. Once again an alien sweeps its gaze across to us but immediately continues the conversation. I try once more. The casing catches onto the strap and I feel the needle pop out, though it’s still stuck to my wrist with tape. I feel the drip fluid dripping down my arm, causing numbness to the skin. I’m probably bleeding now as well, but I think I’m better off without any sedative. Breathe. 

One Grey leaves the room via a circular elevator pad at the far end of the room. The other one comes to take a look at me. He looks at my drip and realizes something is wrong. He looks guilty for a moment, as if he thought he didn’t secure it properly. He tries fixing the drip, loosening the strap to try and get the drip out. Breathe. 

I have to stop this now. I quickly twist my wrist, grabbing the drip and jabbing it hard into Grey’s descending hand. The startled alien wasn’t expecting this at all. It whimpers confused and falls over forward, falling with its head onto my chest, its black eyes staring confused at me. Transparent eyelids close sideways, followed by upper eyelids closing the eyes completely. A chill runs through my spine. I never imagined I would ever be this close to a real Grey. It slides down slumping onto the floor.

With my one hand free I quickly loosen the other strap as well as the leg straps. I quickly roll off the bed between our two beds and take out Vornak’s I.V. drip and untie his straps. I try to wake him up but he’s not responding other than saying “Hello Albert” in broken English and closing his eyes again. 

Colonel Han is on the last bed. I remove his drip as well. He’s waking slowly, but he keeps mumbling incoherently.

What if the other Grey comes back? I take the I.V. drip, it’s the only weapon I have against the Greys. I move towards the elevator pad. The elevator starts humming and descending. There won’t be any second chances, so I run toward it as the legs appear. The Grey seems to be wearing some kind of knee high boot. Running as fast as I can, I thrust the needle with all the force I can muster into the leg just behind the knee. He tries to kick but just falls over, sliding off the descending elevator.

Two down. How many are there? Are we in the flying saucer? I guess there must be a pilot as well. But I wouldn’t know how to control it, since everything here is totally alien technology. There are markings everywhere that must be alien text, but I can’t read any of it. My mind is racing. What should I do next? Make sure the drips don’t fall out of the Greys. I find a roll of tape and quickly tape the drips tightly into the Greys.

I hear the sound of shuffling behind me as I’m securing the drip on the second Grey. I jump up spinning around, ready to throw a punch if necessary. It’s Chief Vornak. He flinches.

“Sorry, I thought you were one of them,” I apologise.

“One of who?” he asks, looking around confused. Then he sees the Grey alien lying on the floor next to me,”Wha..” he lets out a warble and slumps down to the floor in shock.

I hear a hissing sound coming from the middle of the room. A circular opening appears on the floor. I pear down through it. I am definitely in the flying saucer. We are hovering about twenty metres in the air. Through the hole in the floor I can see everyone else lying asleep on the ground at the village center. I hear an alien voice over an intercom as two symbols light up on a screen next to the hole in the floor. One resembles an upward arrow and one downward. Well that seems to be something I can read here. Up arrow to beam them up, down arrow to descend. The pilot must have opened it to return us or load the next lot. I don’t know.

So we can escape. But they might come back, and next time might be worse. The key lies in the pilot. If we could communicate with him somehow, maybe we can figure out if they really are hostile or not. Maybe I should let Vornah down and handle it alone.

The hole in the floor closes. The one chance I had to leave is gone.

Oh no! Are they going to put us to sleep again? It can’t go on like this. I have to face whatever is up that elevator now. This abduction thing has to stop, and right now, I seem to be the only one that can do something about it. 

I get onto the elevator and go up to the next level. At least the directional arrows are easy to navigate. I push the button only to realise it’s holographic. I guess they try to impress lesser species with their “magic” holographs. The elevator rises smoothly. It feels like some kind of grav-lev tech. As the elevator rises I can see three oval chair-like structures of which only one has an occupant. It turns around speaking in its own language until it sees me. 

It stops, staring at me intently. 

“Hello Albert Grey,” a voice echoes in my head,” I am Commander Xalor - a *Grey* as you call us,” a voice echoes in my head. Okay this must be that telepathic communication the Grey abductees always talk about.

“Don’t do any more of that telepathy trickery,” I blurt out,” You partners spoke to each other normally… er well - with their mouths. Whatever. It’s very uncomfortable hearing this voice in my head. I have a lot of questions.”

“Okay, Al,” the Grey answers simply,”Since you’re here, I’m assuming my companions are incapacitated, so you have the upper hand, since I need to control the craft. I will say that I mean you no harm.”

“How do you know my name?” I ask, immediately realising it’s probably a stupid question. He probably got it through ‘telepathy’.

“It wasn’t telepathy, Al,” Xalor continues,”we followed the anomaly here from Earth.”

“How do you know about the anomaly?” I’m confused.

“We picked up its signal ten years ago and have been monitoring it ever since,” Xalor continues.

“So how do you know my name if it wasn’t through telepathy,” I push for an answer.

“You look a lot like your father,” Xalor answers. 
What? I'm really out of my mind now. What is this guy saying? He must be trying to play tricks on my mind. My mom never wanted to talk about my father. She always just said that I would be better off not knowing.

“I never even knew my father,” I stammer, “how did you know him?” a million more questions start welling up in my mind and I just can’t get any sanity out of this.

“Your mother was also an ‘abductee’ as you call them,” he continued,

“She never said anything about such a thing,” I object,” but then she never said anything about my father either…” My mind is a mess right now.

 “I don’t think you’re ready for this, but I think I should let you know before anything else happens…” Xalor pauses and takes a deep breath, ”I was the one assigned to study Angela Grey. Just like you seem to have done now she woke up while I was examining her. Unlike the other subjects, she was excited about this whole alien study thing since she was a molecular biologist. And so together we made many discoveries. The biggest discovery was that I became a father.” he pauses, waiting for me to react.

“With Angela Grey, my mother?” I ask. Grey wasn’t her maiden name. I feel my legs getting weak. Everything is black.

I wake up back on the bed. Was that a dream? I look down at my arms. There are no more straps nor drips. I look up and see Xalor I had been speaking to. Another one is standing in the background going through the test results.

“So you’re saying that you are my father?” I say looking him straight in his deep black eyes. Could this strange creature be my father? 

“Yes,” he answers.

“That’s enough! I can’t take any more of this. I don’t want to know any more of this!” No wonder I was called an alien at school. Now it looks like maybe I ***am*** an alien. Or half alien.

“I figured, since you five are the only humans in this solar system, it would be a lot easier to contact you here than on Sol where there’s always someone on the lookout for us,” Xalor explains, ”I had to see how my son was doing. Plus we have the bonus of studying the anomaly,” then he takes a breath, ”But there is a threat looming over us.”

A groan starts from the bed next to me. Vornak is waking up. Colonel Han is also coming to.

“Since you are all awake now, “ Xalor announces,” We need to talk. The reason I abducted you three is that we are all in grave danger. I would have kept Chief Vornak out of this, but since it is going to affect his people we all need to be ready for what is coming.”

A holographic display appears in front of us showing the Milky Way galaxy.  
“A long time ago, we started exploring the universe. The ship that I descend from was the first to reach another inhabited planet. The species on this planet are called the Argt. The Argt, like us and the Chamaliens, are reptilian species, but they look a lot different.”

The holographic display zooms into a star and then to a planet with a mish-mash of land and oceans. The oceans are smaller compared to Earth, but it has very large mediterranean-like seas and large lakes. The view zooms into the planet's surface. It looks a lot like the Amazon jungle. Zooming in even more, a dark red reptilian creature is displayed. It looks like a cross between a snake and a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The body resembles a puff adder, but the limbs look more like a T-Rex with large talons. The teeth look vampirish with sharp jagged teeth and large fangs.There are also small reptilian horns just above the eyes.

“This is the Argt,” Xalor explains,” They were peaceful when we first met them and we became good allies with a friendly group of Argt called the Kurg. One day out of the blue the Kurg were attacked by all the surrounding tribes because they were keeping the alien tech for themselves. The Kurg leader implored us to help them in the war. We were unwilling since we don’t believe in war and felt it would be unfair towards the others since we could easily obliterate them if we wanted to.”

“This resulted in a lot of our leaders getting assassinated by the Kurg since they decided that we were traitors. They confiscated all our ships and killed our leaders. But they didn’t know how to use our tech and they were overcome by the other tribes. We lived as slaves among these tribes and were constantly tortured to get information on how to recreate our technology. Eventually they figured out the basics and started building their own ships.”

“All the time as slaves we had secretly been fixing up our mothership. When they launched their first ships, we all managed to escape with the mothership while they were celebrating their launches. After many years while continuing to explore the universe, we came upon a planet where we found Argt ruling as gods over a planet of primates. We knew we had to right the wrong we had inadvertently caused. Seeing that talking to the Argt didn’t work, we launched a stealth attack against their temples in such a way that it would seem like the gods have destroyed the temples, setting them free. Since then we have been fighting for any planet we have found oppressed by the Argt. This all happened thousands of years ago, long before my time. Our species have been at war ever since”

Suddenly all the lights go off. Everything is black.

“Don’t move at all,” I hear Xalor’s voice in my head,” no matter what.”

I freeze. I see a light above. It’s the Hell Moon. The night sky all around down to the horizon. The Jungle, the village. I see no Space-ship interior. Have they holographically mapped the outside view to the interior of the ship? These aliens are so advanced, I don’t know what to expect. Why would they do such a thing?

I notice stars in the sky disappearing into the darkness. Why are the stars blacking out? The shape of the blackness covering the stars becomes apparent as triangular. It is huge. Much bigger than this flying saucer that we are(were?) in.

“We are in invisibility mode,” Xalor’s voice continues to echo in my mind,” Don’t move. Remember the Philadelphia Experiment.”

Images of people getting stuck in an invisible ship’s wall float into my mind. What? That crazy sci-fi stuff? Was that real?

“I wasn’t there, so I cannot vouch if it was real,” Xalor’s voice floats back into my head,” But we have created this tech in a similar way to avoid them.”

The dark triangle grows larger, getting closer.

Is that an Argt ship? What if they do something to the village?

I glance down worried about the village, but there’s nothing. Just an endless dark jungle.

As the huge black triangular ship moves silently overhead I can see endless triangular panelling interrupted by triangular holes that could be for weapons or sensors.

The ship passes and I watch for what feels like hours until it finally shoots up into space and disappears from view.

The ship lights return. We are solid again. 

“What happened to the village?” I ask, worried that something happened to them.

“We temporarily transported them to a distant jungle and moved the jungle here,” Xalor announces,” They are now back. Everyone is unharmed.”

“You brought them here!” Colonel Han lashes out,” If it wasn’t for you, they wouldn't have come here.”

“You are right,” Xalor says,” and for thousands of years we have been protecting you just like we did now. But now your military prowess might come in handy to overthrow the Argt”

An explosion interrupts the conversation.

“The Argt attacked!” Xalor cries out,”Brace yourselves!”

 The lights go off and sparks frazzle everywhere. We’re falling. Another crash and the sound of branches breaking under the weight of the craft. I black out.

# **Ch. 10: Revelations** {#ch.-10:-revelations}

“Albert. Al. Al can you hear me?” A nagging voice pulls me out of my sleep. My head hurts. I’m nauseous.

“Al wake up!” Vornak’s voice breaks through my surreal nightmare. 

I slowly open my eyes to see Vornak staring intently at me. In his eyes I see a flicker of hope as I start to move slowly. As my eyes start to focus, I see the remnants of the crash around us. It doesn't look like this ship will ever fly again with this amount of damage. But I guess they did a lot of crash tests on this model since I am still alive.

“Where’s Xalor?" I ask, straining to see if I can see him.

“He’s alive, but barely,” Vornak informs me,” I doing my best to help him.”

A crescendo of expletives arise behind me. Colonel Han has awakened.

“My leg!” Han exclaims, followed by colorful profanities. Trying to get out of my own mist of confusion, I force myself to wake up properly so I can try and help him. My stomach doesn’t agree with my decision to get up. Nausea takes over and I fall down. Breathe. I take another deep breath and get up. In between the mess of metal I make out movement where I heard the voice coming from. 

I try calling the others that are at the village, but it seems we have no connection. Or maybe the crashed silvery interstellar disk is acting as a Faraday cage, blocking all signals.

Han is caught under two crossing metal beams. His right arm and right leg are both pinned down. I try lifting the beam, but it won’t budge. Of course, use the multitool! I flick a button on my wrist and a circular holographic menu pops up. Using gestures I scroll until the cut menu is highlighted. Making sure the tube on my wrist is pointed at the beam only, I select Plasma Cut and proceed on to cutting the beam. 

Eventually we recovered everyone except one of the other Greys who had been piloting when we were attacked. He didn’t make it since he suffered a direct hit. The other Grey was nowhere to be found. We patch Han and Xalor up as best we can, crafting make-ship stretchers from the medical beds.

After cutting through a lot more metal than we were expecting, eventually we break free from the metal cage that had imprisoned us and manage to bring Han and Xalor outside. 

“Han! Al! Can you hear me?” Lea’s voice suddenly breaks through the NeuraPhones.

“Lea! Thank goodness you’re alive!” I exclaim, “We need medical help here urgently. I’m sending you our location marker.”

We start making our way in their direction so as to prevent any delay.

# **Ch. 11: Warning** {#ch.-11:-warning}

When we reach each other, Lea patches up Han and gets him up and about in no time with nanites fixing his leg.

“There is someone else you need to help with, but I think we’ll need to take them to the ship.” I say revealing Xalor to her.

“Oh no!” Lea exclaims,” Really? A real Grey? Are you sure they’re friendly? Maybe it is just a trap gone wrong!”

“So you don’t want to help him?” Han asks.

“Of course I’ll help him, that’s what I do,” Lea answers,” I’m also going to be very careful. But if anything weird happens he’s getting a colonoscopy with no sedation. Also, I’ll need DNA samples from him.”

Back at our ship, Lea scans Xalor and does an analysis of his DNA. I don’t tell anyone about my relationship to Xalor. It’s still way too weird to believe anyway. Colonel Hanand Chief Vornak had promised not to mention it to the others.

“Hmm, there are a few similarities between our DNA, the Chamaliens, and the Greys,” she muses,” and other parts totally different.”

“Can I have a copy of all the aliens’ DNA you have tested so far,” I ask Lea,” I just want to explore and see if I see anything interesting.”

“Oh sure,” Lea answers happily,” It’s great to see that someone else is also interested. I’m creating an alien phylogeny from all this, and it looks like this might confirm panspermia.”

“Great, I’ll keep that in mind,” I try to answer enthusiastically, pretending to be interested in the subjects.”

Xalor recovers and Jane starts chatting with him about space-time continuums and wormholes. They chat for hours, deep into the night, while I look up panspermia and phylogeny, seeing what I can conclude regarding parenthood. The problem is that I don't have DNA samples of my mother nor a sibling here. I’ll have to compare with the other aliens and humans so find out for sure. The initial test results show up on the screen. There’s a lot I don’t understand, but the paternity test shows a 75 percent possibility that he is my father. No. It can’t be. But considering he’s another species, that most probably raises the possibility even more. I’m devastated. It’s true. I’m half alien.I drift away, falling asleep in front of the computer.

It’s morning and Xalor is sitting in the lounge. Han walks up to him and takes a seat across from him.

“We need to talk,” Colonel Han is serious,” what do we do if the Argt attack again? And where are they now? Just because they aren’t firing now, it doesn’t mean they’re not scanning for us or something. This Shuttle stands out like a sore thumb and we need to do something about it.”

“I will see what I can salvage from the wreck and then we can upgrade this ship with our technology,” Xalor said,” I will work on invisibility and shields first.”

Removing parts from the wreck is tedious, but we manage to get as much as possible from the wreck. The locals helped to carry everything with their triceratops-like oxen and their humped mini brontosaurus that resembled camels.

“Why do your people do abductions?” Dr Read asks Xalor angrilly,” It’s become an urban legend and still you went and abducted our people and a Chamalien!”

“After the Argt enslaved us we realised we should not disrupt new planets in any way,” Xalor answered,” but since the Argt were on a destructive mission to enslave any planet they could find, we had to figure out how to protect any species without them noticing us. We come across an inhabited planet and document everything, trying not to disturb anything. In the beginning there were many failures. Whole planets have been enslaved by the Argt. Others that rebelled have even had their planets destroyed so badly that there is no more atmosphere. We have protected many different alien races without them knowing. But our scientific curiosity is also a large drive and we try to learn as much as possible about each species since that would help us protect them and if they needed any other help we could help. We have found that sedation and memory wipes work best with most species. But things go wrong sometimes and this was one of those cases.”

With the help of Xalor we have now upgraded our ship with electromagnetic energy shields, invisibility and a whole host of things that he still needs to explain to us.

We also research and gather all the data we can about where the attack came from, going over all the captured video footage from the flying saucer we could find. We couldn’t find anything. 
Why didn’t they attack again? They could have destroyed us immediately after the first hit. Maybe there was more of an explosion visible on the outside, so much that they thought the ship had disintegrated from the shot.

# **Ch. 12: Rescue** {#ch.-12:-rescue}

I decide to see how Zyratth is doing. 

“Have you noticed the Fire Moon has changed after the attack?” Zyraath asks me.

“What has changed?” I ask, not sure what he’s getting at.

“We know exactly what the Fire Moon looks like and there are more lights that are not normal,” Zyratth answered,” We thought you already knew about that since you have so much knowledge.”

“Thanks for the heads up,” I answer,” We’ll take a closer look with our instruments. I really hope it’s not the Argt. But just in case, tell all the Chamaliens to stay in their caves and try to be invisible whenever you have to go out by changing to the colour of the ground or grass or whatever you are walking on so they can’t see you from the sky.”

As I make my way back, the sun starts setting and that ugly moon rears its head again. I think I just saw a red flash on that moon. I look intently. There does seem to be more regularly arranged red light points. I pick up my pace. I hope that the new shield is working on the Shuttle. As I’m about to enter the Shuttle I see another red flash which hits the area around the shuttle creating a glowing hired dome around the ship and dissipates as the shields installed by Xalor does its work.

I run in and shout, “The Argt are firing from the Hell-Moon!” Thank goodness for the shields Xalor installed on the Space Shuttle.

“Understood, Al. Turning on Invisibility!” Xalor announces “ Nobody move! Remember the Philadelphia Project”

I halt, trying not to fall over from the sudden deceleration. Now it looks like I’m floating high above the slate rock. This invisibility stuff makes me queasy every time.

After a while Xalor stops the invisibility, does a quick scan on the Hell Moon to see where the Argt are and immediately puts the shields back on maximum.

There’s a banging sound on the hull. Someone is banging on the door. The camera view shows Chief Vornak. We open and let him in. I have never seen him in such a state.

“My daughter Varnah!” he cried,” They took her!. There was a big black triangle and then she was gone!”

“Their base is on the Blood Moon.”Colonel Han says,” We need to do something fast. But first we need to protect the tribe. Xalor, what can you do to protect the tribe?”

“I could teleport a large portion of the inside of the mountain into the sea, creating a large communal cave, Xalor muses,” but I need to rebuild the tech first. Then we can use the multitools to create tunnels deep into the jungle without damaging their home caves.”

After Xalor finishes the teleporter tech, he first teleports the ship to the village and then removes a chunk out of the mountain, teleporting it into the sea. Then I start duplicating the multitools, but these are just a basic version that can only dig tunnels in rock and earth. 

We are almost finished now.

Suddenly there’s an explosion. But it wasn’t anywhere near us. 

The explosion is in the sea. There are more shots. It is coming from Hell Moon. 

“I think the Argt saw the chunk of mountain appear in the sea and thought it was a ship!” Cruz laughed mockingly.

“We need to get going with saving the Chief’s daughter!” Colonel Han urges,” Xalor, do you think you can create a small recon craft?”

“If Al and Cruz can help,” Xalor says,” yes.”

Since we are using alien tech,” I ask Xalor,” how about if we could make the craft a mirror cube. That would help with camouflage even when invisibility is disabled.”

“Hmm, interesting,” Xalor is intrigued,” yes, let’s do it.”

We all get to work helping Xalor build the Mirror Cube in the Shuttle’s cargo bay. It's a three meter cube and the mirrors can also display holographic images if necessary.

The Cube is ready now and Xalor teaches us how to control it.

Cruz takes us up in the Shuttle using Xalor’s quantum teleport modification at a position out of view of the Hell Moon base. We quantum teleport out of the shuttle to a position in the night sky view of the Hell Moon base, but it is angled so the mirrors reflect only the emptiness of space, against the background of space. 

I can make out a small fleet of dark triangular ships parked awkwardly in a crater in the black volcanic rocks. We teleport just outside of the crater ridge, out of view of the parked ships.

Xalor, Zyratth and I get out of the cube wearing space suits that we had modified to look like Argt armour. Three different races of Aliens, out to rescue an alien captured by yet another alien race. I’m starting to feel like I may be fitting in now. Zyratth will scan for typical Chamalien movements to try and pinpoint Varnah’s position. She could be in any of the ships. 

Up ahead we see a guard idly patrolling the area. He’s very casual. I’m guessing they think we haven’t figured out where they are. The guard calls out to us. Xalor answers something and the guard is happy with the answer.

“That was just a greeting,” Xalor whispered to us.

As we go from ship to ship, Zyratth doesn’t find anything. The last ship is a smaller vessel. Zyratth puts his hand on the craft and stands still for a while.

“Varlah is here,” Zyratth whispers excitedly.

“How are we going to transport here to the ship, if we manage to free her?” I ask, realizing we didn’t think this through,”We can’t carry a space suit around without looking suspicious.”

“That is not a problem,” Xalor says, taking out a transparent dark orb that floats above his palm, “this is a mini teleporter.”

I’m still not sure how this is going to work. The ship is smaller than the others, but it’s not tiny. It’s basically a flattish angular tetrahedron that is triangular when seen from below. The cockpit is a dark glass triangular corner which is the highest point on the ship and tapers straight to the back wing. 

Xalor finds the door and opens the airlock. No security measures. They definitely are not expecting us. The security guard had also just finished his round and queues behind us to enter.

We all silently realize that we cannot step back now, or it would look suspicious. So we enter. Inside everything is dark grey with low lighting. The guard passes us in the ship and moves toward the back where there is a single door. As he opens the door to enter I catch a glimpse of a white scaled Chamalien. That means Varlah is very scared. 

Zyratth suddenly sprints to the door as fast as the armour can allow him, grabbing the door and lunging at the guard stabbing him with the multitool in one swift motion.

I can’t believe my eyes. What just happened? What if there are other Argt in the room? He might need our help now. I run to the door. Sure enough there is another Argt and he had just grabbed Zyratth by the neck in a stranglehold. Zyratth is struggling with the multitool trying to activate it again. What if this guy calls the other Argt? Instinctively I drive my multitool lazer through his chest cutting his torso off his body. The Argt monster’s chest separates from his body collapsing into a heap of blood and guts. I’m shocked. I’ve never done anything like this before. I never thought I would be able to do such a thing. But my friend Zyratth is alive and safe for now. 

Xalor takes out the floating orb and directs it over Varlah. It starts glowing and then a vertical glowing tear rips through space and seems to swallow her up. She’s gone. Only the orb is left hovering over the floor. It returns to Xalor. Xalor sets something on the sphere.

“We need to get out now!” Xalor says, “This ship is going to disintegrate in sixty seconds. We all rush out. Xalor closes the door gently and we walk as briskly as possible back to the Cube. Varlah is inside, confused and shaking with shock. As we get into the cube the small Argt ship starts falling apart. Lava starts pouring out of the ground beneath the ship and a mini volcano erupts a little enveloping the last few panels of the ship. The black orb rises from the debris and darts back to Xalor. We don’t wait to watch for fear of being caught, as Xalor teleports the cube back to the other side of the Hell Moon where they won’t see us. 

“Those monsters,” Varlah cries,” they …” she breaks out in sobs and starts clinging onto me. I don’t know what to do.

“It’s okay,” I say,” This was a first for me too,” as I put my arm around her shoulder to comfort her. Are chamaliens comforted by hugs? I don’t know, but it seems like the right thing to do. She doesn’t move away, so I assume it’s fine. I shiver at how badly this could have ended.

“We have a problem,” Jane is worried,” we only have two days until the Starship is within range for us to dock again.”

“We can’t leave these people at the mercy of the Argt,” Lea protests,”What are we going to do?”

“We need to sort this out now,” Cruz chips in,” I’m not planning on losing my Starship because of the Argt!”

“Does anyone have any ideas?” Colonel Han asks me.

“Well, it seems to me the Argt have want to get hold of the anomaly in the hydroscoop,” Xalor says, his large black eyes reflecting the scene in the Shuttle,” we can use that as bait as well as a weapon against them.”
