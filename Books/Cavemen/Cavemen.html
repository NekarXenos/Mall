It popped - revealing a shiny silver disk reminiscent of a spinning VW Beetle hubcap clammed onto a silver plate, moving magnitudes faster than a VW Beetle could move in space - even if it would be mounted on a SpaceX Starship. But unfortunately in this spacetime, there were no Volkswagens nor Starships - yet. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Inside sat a humanoid figure resembling a skinny child with a big head and retro Oakley shades. These weren&rsquo;t Oakleys though, since he lacked useful ears or nose to hold them in place. Yet they were full cover contact lens shades - on his large almond shaped eyes. The image of planet Earth reflected in the fresnel of his bulbous bald head, and on his shiny silver space-suit. Yes, he was an alien of the Grey type. Obviously.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oooh Orbito - &nbsp;look at that!&rdquo; Zalex the Grey pointed excitedly at the image of Earth.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a planet with oxygen and water,&rdquo; Orbito - his ship&rsquo;s control A.I. responded - in a bored monotone voice, &ldquo;It probably has fauna and flora - and no tech yet for me to hang out with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Zalex&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with mischief as he declared, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and investigate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With a sudden jolt&mdash;gravity settings forgotten in the rush&mdash;the ship lunged toward Earth, causing Zalex a mild case of whiplash. &ldquo;Oops! Sorry about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Orbito, scan for life-forms.&rdquo; Nothing happened. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo; Zalex released an annoyed sigh.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Following the red dots on the screen like a child looking at which ant to burn through a magnifying glass. They came upon an area that seemed promising with a group of hairy primates wearing animal skins, running on a grassy opening surrounded by forest. Swooping down to get a closer look - suddenly a gigantic tusked creature emerged from the forest knocking the saucer off balance. It wobbled and then clumsily flipped, landing upside down a kilometre away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dangling upside down from his safety belt, Zalex blinked at the now blank screens, trying to comprehend what had just happened. The emergency door flipped open. Outside near a cave, a primate was scribbling on the ground with a stick. The primate&rsquo;s eyes met Zalex&rsquo;s in just the right moment to witness Zalex&rsquo;s safety belts auto release, dropping him head first onto the upside-down craft&rsquo;s ceiling. The primate grunted with a grin and a snicker, pointing at Zalex. Believing the creature&rsquo;s snicker to be a sign of worship&mdash;a classic Grey misinterpretation&mdash;Zalex grinned.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Zalex crawled out and rose to his full five feet stature, staring ominously at the primate. The primate continued his scribblings as if unaware of his presence. The scribblings somewhat resembled a number 72 or maybe an upside down 42 from Zalex&rsquo;s viewpoint. But he wouldn&rsquo;t have known anyway because Greys use an eight-base number system of circles, dots and slashes and Earth didn&rsquo;t have that number system yet.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Greetings, primate. I shall teach you our language and record your reactions,&rdquo; he announced in a tone mixing authority with self-importance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The primate grunted. Or maybe it was a cough. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I hereby name you Og.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Og simply stared at the saucer.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was at this moment that Zalex realised he had a critical problem. Since his ship was out of action, the food dispenser was also out of action, which meant he couldn&rsquo;t maintain his 2 hourly meal times. For a Grey, missing a two-hour meal was catastrophic, especially with a lactose-based digestive system. His mind raced to the one resource he needed&mdash;milk.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then came an astonishing scene: that colossal mammoth, the very creature that had knocked his ship over, was being harnessed by the primate hunters. Dragged on makeshift mammoth tusk sleighs, they drew it through the clearing towards the cave.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">High-pitched shrieks emerged from the cave as a troop of primates emerged, mostly females and their little ones, running to meet the hunters. Then, just like Santa giving out presents, an old primate with a very long grey beard sliced off pieces and gave them to the woman and children.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An incredible scent struck his senses, drawing him closer to the scene of the feast. It was familiar yet different and before he knew it, he had stolen a mammary gland and was chugging its milk like it was the elixir of life&mdash;an act that might have been less impulsive if the mammoth hadn&rsquo;t been female.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With his prized milk stash, Zalex returned to his ship&mdash;only to stop short in astonishment. A group of primates were turning his ship right way up, landing with a soft thud - on the landing legs.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How-?&rdquo; was all he could say. They seemed to ignore the fact that he had stolen their mammoth milk. He entered his seat and continued drinking the milk again. Then something caught his eye. One primate child, wide-eyed and curious, watched from the doorway. In a rare moment of guilt, Zalex shared his stolen milk with the child, a small gesture of goodwill amid the absurdity.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Time passed aimlessly as Zalex taught the primates language and studied their ways. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One day he was sitting in his craft chugging mammoth milk, when he felt like someone was watching him. He looked around, half expecting a child asking for milk. Nothing. But something was different.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you miss me?&rdquo; Orbito&rsquo;s A.I. voice startled Zalex, spilling milk all over himself. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His ship was fixed! The screens flickered alive, filled with positive status reports.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How did that happen?&rdquo; Zalex bewilderedly tried cleaning up the spilt milk.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c6">What</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;happened?&rdquo; Orbito retorted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fixed!&rdquo; Zalex shivered in fear, &ldquo;who fixed you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Orbito sounded confused as well,&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t awake when it happened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Zalex hesitated, half relieved and half wary. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave this place before things get weirder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Okey-dokey, Zalex,&rdquo; Orbito responded cheerfully as the ship rose silently into the air.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">But his curiosity&mdash;and his academic dedication to primate studies&mdash;won out. &ldquo;Beam Og aboard. I want to observe him more closely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In an instant, Og stood next to him. Zalex jumped. Sometimes Orbito knew just how to mess with Zalex.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The craft zoomed silently into the air. As they exited the stratosphere, the craft started wobbling. There was the smell of ozone - and a strange warbling sound that swooped between frequencies in hypnotic ways. Then the craft started shaking and the screens came alive with live video footage. They were already in orbit. Stars glinted with the colourful backdrop of the Milky Way galaxy. But dead ahead there was a gigantic whale-shaped spaceship with a gaping open mouth-shaped landing bay. A tractor beam drew the saucer in and set the saucer down gently in the landing bay, closing the mouth. The saucer&rsquo;s door automatically opened.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thanks for the science lessons, Zalex!&rdquo; Og said as he walked out of the saucer into the space-whale-ship&rsquo;s landing bay. The old bearded man was standing waiting for them, together with a whole group of primates, still wearing animal skins.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How-?&rdquo; Zalex said again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We studied your ship and made a better one.&rdquo; The old man replied, &ldquo;Later we also figured out time travel. So we got messages from our future - they say you Grays like to abduct us humans, we decided we&rsquo;d be ready this time and abduct you right back,&rdquo; His pearly white teeth glinted as he grinned cheerily.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Zalex gulped, sipping at his remaining milk, a mix of wonder and resignation painting his features.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>And so the timeline was changed. On Zalex&rsquo;s planet, rumours of cattle abductions by giant Space whales spread. Cows and Greys would be found to have swapped locations. Greys would wake up to find a cow next to them and their partner roaming lost in a field. And soon</span><span>&nbsp;a group of fur-clad cavemen conquered the galaxy.</span></p></body></html>
