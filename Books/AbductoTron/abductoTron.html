This floor was more spherical, and quite offended by the notion of flatness. Nearby, a depressed milk stout bottle rolled aimlessly, but its existence was of no significance. Suspended in disbelief, a silver hammock swayed gently in the ellipsoidal room. A Got Milk poster hovered above mind-numbingly tedious photos of various cow species, arranged on what might be called a wall if you tried hard enough. Suddenly an excited shaft of red light burst from the button with a series of pew-pew sounds, jolted the hammock and dumped its contents unceremoniously onto the floor. It was a little grey - not the doctor - an alien. Just a typical sight on a flying saucer, really. The registration plate on this one read 48DUC707R0N. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The button zipped up with a racket that sounded suspiciously like &ldquo;Wakey-wakey, Bob!&rdquo; This was clearly a misunderstanding. The alien&rsquo;s name was B08, not Bob. Clad in his least favourite oil slick rainbow pyjama shorts, B08 scowled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ben, I&rsquo;m B08, not Bob!&rdquo; The little grey protested.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah-yeah Bob,&rdquo; Ben the button teased.&rdquo;Time for breakfast!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The button buzzed its way towards the hammock, which transformed into a floating silver tablecloth beside B08. A hole yawned open in the ceiling, depositing a tin of condensed milk and a sachet of protein shake powder. The cloth caught them with a lazy swish.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There is no spoon!&rdquo; B08 grumbled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the button replied smugly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aw, come on,&rdquo; B08 complained,&rdquo; how am I gonna eat breakfast now? You&rsquo;re supposed to be my assistant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There is no spoon,&rdquo; the button buzzed dripping sarcasm.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Two red lasers shot from the button, ricocheting off the walls and cutting precise holes in the tin. B08 sighed, grabbed the stout bottle, and dumped in the green whey powder, followed by the sticky condensed milk.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; he muttered,&rdquo; how am I gonna stir this stuff?&rdquo; His bulbous head pulsed with a faint glow of inspiration. He grabbed the button, popped it into the bottle, and plugged the top with his finger. A vigorous shake sent the button spinning inside, its muffled protests blending the mix into B08&rsquo;s favourite, a thick, neon-green &ldquo;milkshake&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahh, that&#39;s more like it,&rdquo; he said, releasing his finger. The button shot out with a pop. B08 tilted the bottle and let the goop glop down his throat. A faint glow pulsated excitedly through his body with a sugar high. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From somewhere deep in the ship, a faint human squeal echoed, followed by a beep from a floating console labeled &ldquo;Abductee Quarters&rdquo; B08 rolled his black eyes. &ldquo;Same old - same old. I need to change this up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Suit up,&rdquo; he commanded. The cloth engulfed him in a swirling tornado, reconfiguring itself into a skintight silver suit. The button zipped through the air, landing snugly on the suit collar, still dripping with green goop. B08 wiped the goop off with his finger, tasted it and retrieved his finger with a satisfied plop. His thin lips stretched into what might be called a satisfied smile for a grey.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He walked into the wall, which stretched like dough and reshaped with a plop as he entered the control room.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Control Room, Status!&rdquo; he barked, since barking is a normal sound for aliens to make.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of control!&rdquo; Control Room&rsquo;s distorted voice blurted. Control Room was the brain of the living flying saucer, lovingly named Abductotron. Random social media live streams projected onto the walls scattered like moths looking for a non-existent light to crash into.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wh- what happened?&rdquo; B08 wondered why Control Room was never in control.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The subject wanted Wi-Fi,&rdquo; Control Room complained,&rdquo; and then&hellip;&rdquo; A burst of what can only be described as a little girl&rsquo;s tantrum cries through a fax machine sound filter,&rdquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Bob. I failed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s B08!&rdquo; highly irritated,&rdquo; and why is everyone calling me Bob now?&rdquo;&rdquo; he demanded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was the subject, Bob,&rdquo; Control Room protested,&rdquo; she told me that it&rsquo;s your actual name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll show her!&rdquo; B08 angrily threw up his arms into the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a fit of rage, B08 burst through the doughy wall into an empty containment chamber. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Undeterred, he charged into the next chamber. &ldquo;Still nothing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the next. &ldquo;Seriously!?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By now, B08 was seething. Then, with one final, furious burst, he smashed through the fourth wall, and found himself face-to-face with a young human&rsquo;s mobile phone camera pointed directly at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;OMG! No way!&rdquo; she squealed, nearly dropping her phone as she bounced with excitement in her white crop top, blue jeans, and spotless sneakers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m </span><span class="c7">literally</span><span>&nbsp;in a spaceship with an </span><span class="c7">actual</span><span>&nbsp;alien! They say his name is B08! Ooooh, one of my followers said that&rsquo;s leet-speak for Bob! </span><span class="c7">Bob the alien!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is insane!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">B08 scowled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Hold up, lemme get a better angle. Your suit is </span><span class="c7">fabulous</span><span class="c0">! It&rsquo;s giving serious intergalactic fashion week vibes. Bob, babe, do a little wave for my followers!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will not&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ooh! What&rsquo;s this red button?&quot; she exclaimed, with the kind of unrestrained curiosity usually found in toddlers, cats, and people who really should know better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before B08 could so much as emit a horrified gasp, she poked it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>There was a </span><span class="c7">bzzzzt</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the sort normally associated with malfunctioning vending machines and experimental teleportation devices. Then, quite suddenly, she was no longer there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead, she was back on Earth, executing a perfect faceplant into the worn-out carpet of her apartment. Her phone, still valiantly streaming, wobbled in her grip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only one person had witnessed the entire event live: a sleep-deprived conspiracy theorist with a username that looked like a failed CAPTCHA and a firm belief that the moon was hollow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Within minutes, the footage was uploaded to a shadowy UFO forum, captioned with all the subtlety of a neon sign:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">&ldquo;ALIEN CONTACT CONFIRMED!!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.loy37bhngj8l"><span class="c9">Chapter 2: The Plan</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Back at Control Room, B08 was busy brainstorming new ideas on how to spice up the alien hybrid abduction game.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Humans are boring,&rdquo; B08 complained.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I quite liked that last one,&rdquo; Control Room mused wistfully. Social media live streams appeared again all over.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Control Room - you were head over heels in love with her!&rdquo; B08 laughed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; was...not...&rdquo; Control Room said with all the persuasiveness of a sleeping turtle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She was out of your league,&rdquo; B08 teased,&rdquo; she wasn&rsquo;t into control rooms.&rdquo; The social media projections vanished into sad nothingness.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ben the button didn&rsquo;t like the teasing, so he suddenly overcharged the suit causing him to do a double backflip and land on his face. Fortunately for him, the gravity was set to 0.1 G so it wasn&rsquo;t as painful as it was to watch. He scowled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry Control Room, I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt your feelings,&rdquo; B08 apologised, catching on. &rdquo;Let&rsquo;s run the meditation simulation, maybe I can come up with something good,&rdquo; as he sat down on the floor and closed his large black eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The lights dimmed. The whole room transformed into a beautiful tropical jungle. B08 started levitating.A babbling brook flowed over white pebbles below him, then into a waterfall and down into a blue lagoon surrounded by coconut palms. He floated on over to the beach with pure white sand and clear turquoise ocean. Dolphins pranced in the ocean. Then the dolphins started surfing big waves upright, to the sound of Surfing USA. A blue whale joined the scene, and crashed the surfer dolphins wave while spouting with glee.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;B08 shouted. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Immediately the simulation disappeared, but B08 was still hanging helplessly in mid air. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Turn the gravity back on please Control Room!&rdquo; B08 scolded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Control Room did as he was told. B08 somehow managed to fall on his face again as gravity returned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it this time?&rdquo; Button asked with all the interest of a speck of dirt on the floor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Space whales!&rdquo; B08 yelled excitedly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; Control Room objected, projecting images of every large creature from every planet in his database.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; B08 babbled on excitedly,&rdquo; You&rsquo;re a living ship with your own DNA.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Control Room felt like he wasn&rsquo;t going to like this. Or maybe he did, he just didn&rsquo;t want to like it. Just because Bob.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.23n5dzish9s3"><span class="c9">Chapter 3: Action</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the middle of the South Pacific ocean a silver disc streaks across the sky. A blue whale lurched through the air knocking the Abuctotron over, and accidentally grabbed it like a dog with a frisbee. It came down into the water with a huge splash, and dragged the Abuctotron under water.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maximum spin!&rdquo; B08 ordered. The Abuctotron started spinning rapidly, causing the whale to spin like a propeller. They flew out the water wobbling like a levitating fly fan. Eventually the whale got too dizzy to hold on and flew off into the horizon. But it didn&rsquo;t make it, instead it landed with a big splash a couple of hundred meters away, and went down to sulk.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you get the DNA sample, Control Room?&rdquo; B08 asked excitedly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um kinda sorta, Bob,&rdquo; Control Room answered, full of insecurity,&rdquo;It seems the sea water and the spinning washed most of it off.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Just then a humpback whale broke through the water lurching itself into the air.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay Control Room,&rdquo; B08 commanded excitedly,&rdquo; tractor beam that whale into space with enough water to contain it and add some air for breathing. Quickly!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In a flash the Abuctotron zapped the whale. It reappeared in a giant blob of water in space. Beaches all over suddenly became larger as the sea line receded. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Abuctotron zipped around the whale taking samples until it was finished.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As they left, B08 had to remind the Control Room to return the whale. It landed with a huge splash and for a moment there was high tide everywhere. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Down under the ocean, a blue whale and a humpback tried consoling each other. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Control Room,&rdquo; B08 cammanded,&rdquo; to the far side of the Moon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Abductotron zipped to the far side of the Moon, stopping abruptly throwing B08 against the wall.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;CHRiSPi!&rdquo; B08 called.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A large white egg shaped CRISPR DNA 3d printing device blobbed through the dough wall and stopped in front of B08 with a wobble.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Randomise the character creator, CHRiSPi.&rdquo; Holograms appeared above CHRiSPi showing a variety of Abuctotron whale crossbreeds. One looked just like a silver humpback whale. Another looked like a massive barnacle. The next one seemed to look like a giant silver Blue-whale, so huge the edges clipped out of the room, &nbsp;that you couldn&rsquo;t get the complete view at once.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&lsquo;s the one!&rdquo; B08 was excited,&rdquo; Set up the external incubator.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">An iridescent bubble appeared on top of the centre of the Abuctotron and grew. It kept growing until it seemed almost half the size of the moon. But actually it was only a quarter of the size.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This will take a while,&rdquo;B08 said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and hibernate for now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.prhmcfll5dq0"><span class="c9">Chapter 4: Event Horizon</span></h1><h4 class="c4" id="h.m3avg0a40gn2"><span class="c14"></span></h4><p class="c3"><span class="c0">B08 woke up with a start, falling out of his hammock with a face plant. Something didn&rsquo;t feel right. Was there something wrong with the gravity?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He burst through the wall as was his custom. Button followed, dragging the silver cloth hurriedly to suit up just as he entered the control room.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, Control Room?&rdquo; B08 demanded. Silence. &ldquo;Control Room?&rdquo; B08&#39;s voice seemed to echo in emptiness.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wha-what happened?&rdquo; Control Room startled awake.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why were you sleeping, Control Room?&rdquo; B08 asked suspiciously.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Control Room was still busy trying to figure out what happened. &ldquo;I must have dozed off since nothing was happening.

Certain parts were recognisable but seemed somewhat disjointed as well as invisible other than warping the view. But the tail was a hundred meters away to one side, while the fins were either side of the ship in the opposite direction.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it seems a glass Space Whale swallowed the Abductotron.&rdquo; B08 concluded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We are inside the Space Whale, flying saucer and all?&rdquo; Control Room suddenly felt out of control again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because you weren&rsquo;t in control as usual&rdquo; B08 scolded, &rdquo;it probably grew around our ship or something&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It seems I am fused into the Space Whale somehow,&rdquo; Control Room informed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How are we going to navigate this thing?&rdquo; B08 was perplexed,&rdquo; open the hatch, let&rsquo;s see it,&rdquo; he said as he put on his fishbowl helmet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As he descended down the blue tractor beam, he noticed he could actually &ldquo;see&rdquo; the layout of the whale by the diffraction of the stars, but it was still difficult.
