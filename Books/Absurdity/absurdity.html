After failing his Planetary Abduction certification three times, his supervisor had given him one final chance: bring back a single Earth cow for analysis, or face reassignment to the dreaded Asteroid Belt Monitoring Division.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Just one cow,&quot; Zyx muttered to himself as he hovered over a sleepy Iowa farm. &quot;How hard could it be?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through his viewscreen, he spotted the perfect specimen&mdash;a plump Holstein grazing peacefully in a moonlit field. Zyx activated the tractor beam and watched with satisfaction as the confused bovine began to rise into the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Moooooo!&quot; protested the cow, kicking its legs frantically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Almost there,&quot; Zyx whispered, his large grey fingers dancing across the control panel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s when he noticed the warning light. The cow was heavier than anticipated, straining the ship&#39;s stabilizers. Before Zyx could adjust, the craft lurched sideways. He frantically grabbed the control stick as the saucer began to spin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, no, no!&quot; he cried, desperately trying to regain control as the ship whirled through a cornfield, flattening complex geometric patterns in its wake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The final indignity came when the cow&mdash;still suspended in the tractor beam&mdash;swung around and crashed into the main engine housing. The saucer sputtered, sparked, and plummeted into the cornfield with a resounding THUD.</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farmer Jenkins was enjoying his morning coffee when he noticed the strange metallic disc half-buried in his cornfield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be,&quot; he muttered, approaching the crashed saucer. A small grey figure sat dazed in the cockpit, its oversized head lolling to one side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jenkins, a practical man who&#39;d survived three recessions through sheer resourcefulness, didn&#39;t waste time asking questions. After helping the disoriented alien to a makeshift bed in his barn, he turned his attention to the spacecraft.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm, with a few modifications, this could replace my broken combine harvester.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Three days later, Jenkins had the saucer up and running again. He&#39;d repurposed the anti-gravity drive to hover over his fields and attached his old harvesting equipment to the bottom. The confused alien, whom Jenkins now called &quot;Al,&quot; seemed content enough helping around the farm, especially after discovering an unexpected affinity for the cows he&#39;d originally come to abduct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One evening, Jenkins was testing his new &quot;hover-harvester&quot; when he accidentally hit what must have been the hyperdrive button. The corn field disappeared in a flash of light.</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the disorientation passed, Jenkins found himself hovering above a lush jungle landscape. Below, a tribe of large, hairy, ape-like creatures huddled around primitive fire pits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good lord,&quot; Jenkins gasped. &quot;I&#39;ve gone to Planet of the Apes!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ape-beings noticed the floating disc and began howling and pointing. Several threw spears that bounced harmlessly off the hull.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ve got to get out of here,&quot; Jenkins muttered, frantically pressing buttons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just then, Al appeared beside him, awakened by the commotion. The alien&#39;s eyes widened with recognition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Home!&quot; Al squeaked in his limited English. &quot;My people!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jenkins looked again at the primitive ape-creatures. &quot;Those are your people? But you&#39;re... grey and... well, alien-looking.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Al shook his oversized head and pointed to a small device on his wrist. With a click, his appearance shimmered and transformed into that of one of the ape-beings below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Disguise,&quot; Al explained. &quot;Study primitive species. Got lost. Thank you, cow-friend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Jenkins was speechless. All this time, the aliens had been studying </span><span>creatures bearing a resemblance to humanity&#39;s evolutionary predecessors</span><span class="c0">?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could process this revelation, the ship&#39;s alarms blared. Several ape-aliens had climbed nearby trees and were now leaping onto the saucer, curious about the strange object.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They damage ship!&quot; Al cried. &quot;Need help!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jenkins, thinking quickly, reached into his overalls and pulled out his secret weapon&mdash;the harmonica he always carried for lonely nights in the field. He began to play a jaunty tune.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The effect was instantaneous. The ape-aliens froze, entranced by the strange sounds. Some began swaying to the rhythm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They like music!&quot; Jenkins exclaimed between breaths.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Play more!&quot; urged Al, hitting switches to stabilize the craft.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the next hour, Jenkins performed every song he knew, from &quot;Oh Susanna&quot; to &quot;Sweet Home Alabama,&quot; while Al repaired the ship. The ape-aliens gathered below in growing numbers, dancing and hooting along.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the repairs neared completion, one particularly bold ape-alien managed to swing into the cockpit. Instead of attacking, it grabbed Jenkins&#39; spare harmonica and began awkwardly mimicking his actions, producing wheezy, discordant notes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;First contact,&quot; Al whispered reverently. &quot;Musical exchange.&quot;</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Six months later, Jenkins&#39; farm had become Iowa&#39;s hottest tourist attraction: &quot;Jenkins&#39; Intergalactic Petting Zoo and Cosmic Jamboree.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Twice a week, the repurposed saucer would bring a small group of ape-aliens to Earth for a cultural exchange program. The aliens, it turned out, had a natural talent for bluegrass music, and &quot;The Milky Way Monkeys&quot; had just signed their first record deal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Al, now the official ambassador between worlds, had settled comfortably into farm life. He still flinched whenever they served hamburgers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As for the cow that started it all? She had her own special pen with a sign reading &quot;First Intergalactic Diplomat,&quot; and enjoyed celebrity status among both species.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And those crop circles? Jenkins had the patterns trademarked and was making a fortune on t-shirts and baseball caps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You know,&quot; Jenkins told Al one evening as they watched the sunset, &quot;some would call this whole situation crazy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Al nodded, strumming his banjo. &quot;On my planet, we have saying: Sometimes wrong turn lead to right place.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The cow mooed in agreement.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c30 c3 c8 title" id="h.b9b74qmyzxnw"><span class="c6 c18"></span></p><ol class="c24 lst-kix_npjsoejmw6rj-0" start="3"><li class="c9 c8 li-bullet-0"><h1 id="h.oaz2zfdibk5s" style="display:inline"><span class="c14 c6">&nbsp;A Day in the Life of Blipnar on Glomulus IX </span></h1></li></ol><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Glomulus IX was a planet of remarkable consistency. The sky was always a dull shade of pewter, the temperature hovered perpetually at a comfortable 22.3 degrees Celsius, and nothing particularly interesting ever happened. This suited the Greys perfectly, as they were not fans of surprises, loud noises, or anything that required more than mild curiosity. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Blipnar awoke precisely at the allotted time, as all Greys did, because the sun never actually rose or set on Glomulus IX. It merely hung there, like a dim bulb someone had forgotten to switch off. Blipnar blinked his massive black eyes, yawned from his barely visible slit of a mouth, and floated out of bed with the grace of a helium balloon that wasn&rsquo;t quite sure if it wanted to reach the ceiling. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His habitat pod was, as mandated by the Grand Council of Utter Predictability, perfectly spherical and painted in a shade of grey so neutral it was often mistaken for a philosophical statement. Blipnar shuffled to the Nutrition Assimilator, which politely hummed before dispensing a blob of nutrient gel with all the flavor and excitement of damp cardboard. Greys didn&rsquo;t eat for pleasure; they ate because not doing so resulted in highly inconvenient fainting spells. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He slurped the gel, which required minimal chewing, an evolutionary quirk due to their tiny mouths and general dislike of unnecessary movement. As he swallowed, his oversized eyes drifted to the Information Orb, hovering obediently at eye level. It flickered to life, broadcasting the day&rsquo;s news in soothing monotones: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing of significance occurred yesterday. Forecast for today: mild temperature, no precipitation, and a continued absence of noteworthy events. The Council reminds all citizens to maintain tranquility and avoid any thoughts of spontaneity.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Blipnar nodded, satisfied. Spontaneity was the leading cause of mild anxiety, and mild anxiety was best avoided. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was time for his daily work shift at the Analysis Complex, where he was tasked with observing Earth and ensuring humans didn&rsquo;t do anything too clever. This was largely unnecessary, as humans were quite good at being stupid without any interference. Nevertheless, it was protocol, and Greys loved protocol the way Earthlings loved cat videos. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He floated into his Transport Bubble and drifted to the Complex, where identical Greys sat in identical spheres, gazing at monitors showing Earth&rsquo;s broadcast signals. Blipnar&rsquo;s monitor tuned to a human documentary entitled *Cooking for One: Embracing Your Crushing Loneliness.* He shuddered. Humans were baffling. They had emotions, which were like illnesses, except more contagious and vastly more inconvenient. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He made a note: *Subject appears to be leaking from ocular cavities while consuming burnt vegetable matter. Hypothesis: Faulty nutrient assimilation technique or emotional malfunction.* &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, his monitor flickered, then displayed static. Blipnar&rsquo;s heart&mdash;small, efficient, and programmed to beat at a modest pace&mdash;skipped. Static was unpredictable. Static was... unexpected. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before his anxiety could fully blossom, the static cleared, revealing the face of a human in a strange red hat, speaking rapidly. Blipnar turned up the volume: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...and for just $19.99, you can get the complete collection! Call now and receive a bonus inflatable garden gnome!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Blipnar blinked. What was a garden gnome? He had to know. There was no protocol for this. His three-fingered hand trembled as he activated the Research Index. &ldquo;Garden gnome,&rdquo; he whispered. The computer whirred, then displayed an image of a tiny, grinning humanoid statue. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Blipnar&rsquo;s mouth twitched. It was the closest any Grey had come to a smile in over two centuries. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A thought&mdash;wild, dangerous, and utterly irresponsible&mdash;crossed his mind: *I want one.* &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He shook his head, horrified by his own recklessness. Desire was the first step to deviation. Deviation led to unpredictability. Unpredictability was... fun. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Blipnar exhaled slowly, calming himself. No one needed to know. No one would know. He glanced around. His colleagues stared blankly at their screens, blissfully unaware. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Returning to his duties, Blipnar tried to focus on the documentary, but his mind wandered to the garden gnome. Maybe, just maybe, tomorrow would be a little less predictable. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And for a Grey on Glomulus IX, that was as radical as it got. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c24 lst-kix_npjsoejmw6rj-0" start="4"><li class="c9 c8 li-bullet-0"><h1 id="h.8qdidtaq0c0c" style="display:inline"><span class="c14 c6">The Narrative Anomaly</span></h1></li></ol><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ship&#39;s AI, **S.A.M.** (Storytelling Assistance Module), flickered to life. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Captain, we have a problem.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Captain Jax leaned back in his chair, tossing a snack into his mouth. &ldquo;Oh, let me guess.

Someone&rsquo;s writing us. Right now.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that exact moment, Jax raised an eyebrow. Not because he wanted to, but because the unseen *author* thought it would be a dramatic response. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; Jax said, standing up. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">S.A.M.&rsquo;s holographic form materialized, flickering uncertainly. &ldquo;There are inconsistencies.

Maybe the author&rsquo;s going for a grittier aesthetic.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s Crewman Ensign McRedshirt,&rdquo; S.A.M. continued. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">McRedshirt, who had been quietly eating soup in the corner, perked up. &ldquo;Oh wow, I got a full name this time!&rdquo; He beamed&mdash;until he realized what it meant. &ldquo;Wait. Oh no. No, no, no.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ship suddenly jolted, shaking violently. McRedshirt screamed as a console exploded next to him. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jax pointed. &ldquo;See? That&rsquo;s classic *expendable crew member* treatment.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">McRedshirt scrambled to his feet. &ldquo;I REFUSE TO BE A TROPE! I HAVE HOBBIES! A PET LIZARD! I&mdash;&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An airlock spontaneously opened, sucking him into space. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jax sighed. &ldquo;Damn.

This time, everything flickered, as if the universe itself was experiencing writer&rsquo;s block. The stars outside pulsed unnaturally. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yep, I see it,&rdquo; Jax said. &ldquo;Any ideas?&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We could try to reason with the author.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jax cracked his knuckles. &ldquo;Hey, writer! You up there? Give me control of my own actions!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a pause.

What a swell individual!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His eyes widened in horror. &ldquo;No!

A swirling void of unfinished sentences and half-written ideas floated before them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jax took a deep breath. &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m jumping in.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before the author could stop him, Jax leaped into the void&mdash; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&mdash;And everything went black. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">--- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, suddenly, YOU, the reader, felt a presence.

Are you one of those little grey guys? Dude, you&rsquo;re tiny! What&rsquo;s up with those eyes? Are you a telepath? Wait, wait&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell me.

How do you like *that* image?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Norb, despite his extensive training in interspecies psychology, recoiled. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Cease vocal emissions,&quot; he said through the ship&rsquo;s translator. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dave did not cease. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Man, this place is high-tech. What do these buttons do? OOH, is that a tractor beam? Can I push it? Can I drive the ship? You should totally let me drive the ship!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Norb turned to his ship&rsquo;s AI, CHRISPI. &ldquo;Scan for cognitive anomalies.

This one was&mdash; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait. You&#39;re reading my thoughts, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Dave squinted at Norb. &quot;Okay, but if you&#39;re reading my thoughts and I&rsquo;m thinking about you reading my thoughts, does that mean you&rsquo;re reading my thoughts about you reading my thoughts? Dude. That&rsquo;s deep.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Norb blinked his massive black eyes. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dave grinned. &quot;Oh, I broke you, didn&rsquo;t I?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Norb, for the first time in his existence, felt doubt. He consulted the ship&rsquo;s logs. The standard protocol for handling an anomaly was to return it immediately. But Dave was *worse* than an anomaly. He was *a disruption*. If returned to Earth, he could tell others about this experience, and while no one would believe him, the sheer *chaotic energy* of his presence might ripple outward, destabilizing the delicate balance of the human species. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This required drastic action. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;New plan,&quot; Norb said. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He pressed a button.

A zookeeper in London reported that the chimpanzees had formed a trade union and were demanding better food. An orangutan in Borneo published a philosophical treatise titled *Why Are You Like This?* which, upon translation, turned out to be a scathing critique of human urban planning.

Every intelligent primate species was invited to send a delegation. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>- The </span><span class="c11">Chimpanzees </span><span class="c0">sent a delegation of warriors, who immediately declared war on the hotel minibar. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>- The </span><span class="c11">Gorillas </span><span class="c0">arrived in solemn robes, having declared themselves the galaxy&rsquo;s foremost experts in deep thinking and chest-thumping. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>- The </span><span class="c11">Orangutans </span><span class="c0">sent one representative, a 200-year-old elder who refused to speak, preferring to stare meaningfully at people until they left the room in confusion. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>- The </span><span class="c11">Baboons </span><span class="c0">came armed, convinced this was all an elaborate ambush. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>- The </span><span class="c11">Macaques </span><span class="c0">promptly stole everything that wasn&rsquo;t nailed down and resold it at inflated prices. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>- The </span><span class="c11">Bonobos </span><span class="c0">were asked to leave after fifteen minutes for &quot;excessively affectionate behavior.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was during this meeting that humanity realized two very important things. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">1. They were no longer in charge. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">2. They had never really been in charge in the first place. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The First Inter-Species War broke out when an ambitious chimpanzee general declared that &quot;the era of human dominance is over&quot; and led an army of baboons into Paris. The humans, who were used to wars involving tanks and airstrikes, found themselves hopelessly outmatched by a species that had mastered the art of warfare *before* discovering agriculture. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After three weeks of chaos (in which the Louvre was claimed as &quot;Chimp Territory&quot; and the Eiffel Tower was repurposed into a gibbon habitat), a truce was declared. The new world order was negotiated by an ancient orangutan, who had remained silent for the entire war but ended it with a single wise sentence: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c25 c6 c11">&quot;Really, must we?&quot; </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c8" id="h.bk2qeq94bdzc"><span class="c20 c6">The New World &nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the end, a compromise was reached.

He was pondering an improvement to his wireless energy transmission device when the entire room was suddenly bathed in an eerie, flickering light. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tesla sighed. He recognized this light. He had seen it before. It was the sort of light that suggested something was very wrong with the fabric of space-time, or that someone had accidentally plugged an alternating current device into a direct current socket. Both had happened to him before. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A shimmering hole in the air appeared, and out of it stepped a small, grey-skinned creature with an oversized head, large black eyes, and an expression of deep existential regret. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ah,&quot; said Tesla, adjusting his spectacles. &quot;A visitor.

You have 278 patents. Your understanding of electricity is unparalleled. And&mdash;&quot; he glanced at a small device in his hand, which appeared to be a sort of cosmic clipboard, &quot;&mdash;you once built a death ray just to see if you could.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tesla beamed. &quot;Ah, you&rsquo;ve done your research!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Tesla could offer tea, Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k pressed a button, and the room dissolved in a shimmer of light. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They reappeared inside what Tesla immediately recognized as an utterly shambolic spacecraft. It was circular, with a spinning outer rim and a worrying number of exposed wires sparking in places where wires ought not to spark. The smell of burnt toast and existential despair hung in the air. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well,&quot; Tesla said, rubbing his hands together, &quot;this is a disaster.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k groaned. &quot;Tell me about it. I was en route to Proxima Centauri when my gravity drive shorted out. I tried to fix it, but the ship&#39;s manual is in </span><span class="c11">Regulan</span><span class="c0">, and my translator only works on languages spoken by species with lips. So instead of translating the instructions, it just repeats &lsquo;Mmmhphhphh&rsquo; in a vaguely apologetic tone.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tesla nodded sympathetically. &quot;This is why I always write my notes in Serbian. It confuses my rivals and ensures only I understand my own brilliance.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k stared at him. &quot;Yes, well.

Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k had eaten half of Tesla&rsquo;s sandwich and was feeling somewhat regretful about it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tesla stepped back, admiring his work. &quot;There. I have rerouted your quantum capacitor through a high-frequency resonance transformer, creating a stable electromagnetic field. Your ship should now function at full capacity.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k pressed a button on his control panel. The ship hummed to life, lifted slightly off the ground, and then, rather unexpectedly, turned into a large, floating pigeon. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tesla blinked. &quot;That&hellip; was not supposed to happen.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k groaned and massaged his oversized forehead. &quot;What did you </span><span class="c11">do</span><span class="c0">?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tesla adjusted his collar. &quot;Well, I may have slightly altered the fundamental quantum properties of the ship&rsquo;s matter-state. But look!&quot; He pointed excitedly. &quot;It flaps its wings quite gracefully.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The pigeon-spaceship let out a dignified *coo* and pecked at the floor. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k sighed. &quot;Alright. Fine. Can you turn it back?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tesla stroked his chin. &quot;Possibly. But first, I must conduct an experiment to determine whether it still operates as a spacecraft.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You mean fly it?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tesla beamed. &quot;Precisely!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k could object, Tesla leaped into the pilot&rsquo;s seat and pressed a button at random. The ship-pigeon lurched forward with an elegant flap and shot through space, leaving behind a bewildered Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k and several very confused astronomers on Earth. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From that day on, Tesla was never seen again. Some say he retired to a life of quiet study. Others say he simply vanished. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But in certain parts of the galaxy, there are legends&mdash;whispers of a brilliant human scientist flying through the cosmos in a great, glowing pigeon, laughing madly as he discovers the secrets of the universe. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And somewhere, Bz&rsquo;R&rsquo;k is still standing in Tesla&rsquo;s laboratory, shaking his head, wondering why he didn&rsquo;t just call roadside assistance.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c24 lst-kix_npjsoejmw6rj-0" start="10"><li class="c9 c8 li-bullet-0"><h1 id="h.mwkrv6n8hyqe" style="display:inline"><span class="c14 c6">Love at First Abduction</span></h1></li></ol><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c8" id="h.4y1a9od5w5ym"><span class="c6">In Which a Flying Saucer Meddles in Romance </span><span class="c20 c6">&nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are many ways to meet the love of your life.

This was somewhat ironic. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They found themselves in a smooth, silver room, lying on a table under an uncomfortably bright light, while an extremely unimpressed Grey alien examined a clipboard. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Good, you&rsquo;re both awake,&quot; said the alien, in perfect English. &quot;Let&rsquo;s get started, shall we?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c8" id="h.crgxu2xo8cy4"><span class="c20 c6">Love is Highly Probable (Statistically Speaking) &nbsp;</span></h3><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The alien, who introduced himself as Bob (short for B08-GREY), tapped his clipboard with the air of someone who had far too many abductees to process that night. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Right.

Towering trees stretched high into the mist, their leaves the size of sailboats. The air smelled fresh, with a hint of something nutty.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he heard it&mdash;a deep, rhythmic chanting.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c8" id="h.mydm2tvj93ho"><span class="c20 c6">The Leaf Lords</span></h3><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vance crouched behind a massive root and peered through the foliage.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A procession moved through the jungle&mdash;a dozen massive gorilla-like beings, draped in woven cloaks of golden leaves. Their fur ranged from deep black to silver, their eyes filled with intelligence.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But the most incredible part? They were riding hairy bison the size of SUVs.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The bison&rsquo;s thick woolly coats were braided with decorative vines, and their massive horns were painted with intricate symbols. At the center of the procession, a particularly regal-looking silverback rode a bison with gilded tusks. His cloak shimmered with thousands of layered leaves.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vance&rsquo;s translator buzzed in his ear, struggling to decipher the language.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Honor... the Sky...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then the silverback raised a massive fist and pointed&mdash;right at Vance.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c8" id="h.ij38tu6uawle"><span class="c20 c6">The Trial of the Sky Walker</span></h3><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Within minutes, Vance was surrounded. The gorillas, or Viridians, didn&rsquo;t attack but herded him onto a waiting bison. Its thick, shaggy fur smelled like fresh earth and&mdash;oddly&mdash;mint.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They rode to an enormous stone citadel, built into a mountainside, with waterfalls cascading down terraces. Inside, torches flickered, illuminating murals of gorillas watching the sky, carving symbols, and building machines.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vance&rsquo;s eyes widened. This wasn&rsquo;t just a primitive society&mdash;this was a civilization on the verge of a Renaissance.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The silverback, now seated on a throne woven from roots and vines, studied Vance.

The beast snorted, its painted horns gleaming.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozu handed him a leaf-woven harness. &ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moktar mounted his own bison with ease, giving Vance a smug grin.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rules were simple: race through the jungle, avoid obstacles, and reach the stone arch at the end. First to pass wins.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vance took a deep breath and climbed onto his bison. It let out a deep, resonant snort&mdash;the sound of a creature that had seen too much nonsense in its life.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A Viridian elder raised a ceremonial leaf-staff. &ldquo;BEGIN!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The bison exploded into motion.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c8" id="h.arehfw714ps3"><span class="c20 c6">A Sky Walker&rsquo;s Trick</span></h3><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Branches whipped past Vance&rsquo;s head as he clung to the harness.

Instantly, his weight lightened, allowing him to shift effortlessly with the bison&rsquo;s movements.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He crouched low, balancing perfectly. &ldquo;Alright, big guy, let&rsquo;s move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He tugged the reins, guiding the bison around a fallen tree instead of plowing through it like Moktar.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The silverback glanced back, eyes widening. &ldquo;Sky magic?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vance grinned. &ldquo;Nah.

Neck and neck.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vance whispered, &ldquo;Come on, buddy. Just a little more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The bison leaped, clearing a final rock obstacle.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They crossed the arch first.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The crowd erupted in cheers.

Not because he was unqualified&mdash;quite the opposite. He had six PhDs, three honorary doctorates, and a restraining order from the Nobel Committee after an incident involving an unlicensed particle accelerator and the Swedish royal family. No, the issue was that Reginald had a tendency to do things&mdash;things that had consequences. And academia, at its core, prefers consequences to remain firmly theoretical.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His latest endeavor was what he called the Transdimensional Quantum Entanglement Perambulator, which, despite sounding like a steampunk baby stroller, was, in fact, a portal to another world. Or possibly a very aggressive microwave. Either way, it was guaranteed to make reality deeply uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His lab assistant, Mila, was a skeptical young woman whose primary job was to remind Dr. Throckmorton that just because something was theoretically possible didn&rsquo;t mean it should be attempted indoors. She had a special fire extinguisher labeled &quot;For Reginald&rsquo;s Shenanigans&quot; and kept a preemptive apology letter addressed to &quot;whom it may concern&quot; at all times.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Mila!&quot; Reginald bellowed from behind a mass of wires, blinking lights, and at least one piece of alien technology he absolutely should not have had. &quot;Throw the lever!&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Which one?&quot; Mila asked, surveying the bank of suspiciously sparking switches.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;The big one. With the skull and crossbones.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That one says &#39;DO NOT THROW UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Exactly! If it was safe, I wouldn&rsquo;t need an assistant.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the long-suffering sigh of a woman who had, at this point, simply accepted her fate, Mila threw the lever. There was a deep whomph, the scent of singed eyebrows (her own, regrettably), and suddenly, a glowing rift in space-time appeared before them.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It shimmered with the sort of light that physicists described as &quot;non-Euclidean&quot; and regular people described as &quot;I need to sit down.&quot; Then, before either of them could say something pithy about the laws of physics being overrated, the rift yoinked them both through.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They landed in a heap on the other side, Mila clutching the fire extinguisher like a security blanket.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Mila,&quot; Reginald whispered, staring around in awe. &quot;I think we&rsquo;ve just discovered the home planet of the Greys.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And indeed, they had. It was a vast, sprawling world covered in sleek, mysterious architecture, an unsettling number of blinking lights, and what appeared to be an entire bureaucracy dedicated to probing things that really ought to be left unprobed.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A short, spindly Grey alien in a lab coat wandered over, regarding them with large black eyes that somehow managed to express equal parts curiosity and exasperation.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, for the love of the Grand Cosmic Conspiracy,&quot; the Grey sighed. &quot;How did you two get here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Quantum entanglement!&quot; Reginald beamed. &quot;And also a mild disregard for personal safety.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Grey pinched the bridge of his oddly smooth nose. &quot;Great.

Greys are real. We&rsquo;ve been visiting Earth for millennia. But honestly, you people make our jobs easy. Half the time, we don&rsquo;t even need to cover things up. Humans do it for us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mila frowned. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vylqx led them to a giant holographic screen displaying live Earth footage. &quot;Look at this,&quot; he said, pointing to a particularly blurry video of a flying saucer. &quot;What do humans do? Immediately post it on the internet, where&mdash;within minutes&mdash;it&rsquo;s surrounded by comments arguing about whether it&rsquo;s CGI, swamp gas, or a trick of the light. You lot invented misinformation way before we did. We&rsquo;re just&hellip; facilitating.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reginald was practically vibrating with excitement. &quot;So, you mean all the conspiracy theories are real?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vylqx hesitated. &quot;Some of them. Others are just nonsense humans made up that we then had to make real so people wouldn&rsquo;t get too close to the actual truth. It&rsquo;s a nightmare, honestly. Do you know how much effort it takes to make sure Bigfoot is seen just often enough to remain a mystery but not enough to be verifiable?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mila rubbed her temples. &quot;This is giving me a headache. Can we go home now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vylqx sighed and pointed to a glowing portal in the distance. &quot;Fine. But if anyone asks, you were abducted by a swamp gas balloon in the shape of Venus, okay? We&rsquo;ve got a reputation to maintain.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reginald grinned as they stepped through the portal back to their lab. &quot;Mila,&quot; he said, practically giddy, &quot;I think we&rsquo;ve just discovered the greatest scientific truth in history.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mila shook her head. &quot;You mean the greatest conspiracy in history.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reginald considered this, then beamed. &quot;Even better!&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c24 lst-kix_npjsoejmw6rj-0" start="13"><li class="c9 c8 li-bullet-0"><h1 id="h.qycwe4q6cyio" style="display:inline"><span class="c14 c6">The Battle of Ludicrousness: A Gorillapolis Saga</span></h1></li></ol><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a day like any other in the bizarre world of Gorillapolis, where evolution had taken a rather dramatic detour. The gorillas, with their penchant for theatrics and over-the-top cultural mashups, had divided into two distinct factions. On one side, there were the Samurai Gorillas, clad in impractically ornate armor and wielding swords as sharp as their wit (which, let&rsquo;s face it, wasn&rsquo;t razor-sharp). They preferred the noble companionship of bison as their war steeds, mostly because horses had politely declined involvement in such nonsense.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the other side were the Mammoth-Riding Gorillas. Mammoths, as it turned out, were surprisingly agreeable to the idea of being ridden, as long as they received a steady supply of peanut butter sandwiches. These gorillas had adopted the rather questionable strategy of replicating Viking culture&mdash;helmets with horns, incomprehensible shouting, and occasional pillaging&mdash;but their helmets were often mistaken for salad bowls by their rivals, which was a point of some consternation.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two factions had been embroiled in a feud for centuries, ever since the Great Banana Treaty of Gorillapolis had failed due to an argument over whether bananas should be peeled from the top or the bottom. It was, as all great gorilla historians agree, an utterly stupid reason for a war. But, wars have been fought over less.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On this particular day, a grand battle was to take place in the Valley of Ludicrousness&mdash;a name chosen by the Gorillapolis Marketing Board to boost tourism. The Mammoth-Riding Gorillas had assembled in an impressive formation, their mammoths adorned with war paint that vaguely resembled doodles by toddlers. The Samurai Gorillas, ever dramatic, had spent hours perfecting their entrances, which involved elaborate bison choreography, synchronized helmet gleaming, and a drum solo by a particularly talented gorilla named Greg.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the battle commenced, it quickly became apparent that neither faction had any idea what they were doing. The Mammoth-Riding Gorillas attempted to charge, only to realize that mammoths were more interested in grazing on nearby bushes. The Samurai Gorillas, in turn, tried to perform an ancient sword kata, which somehow resulted in a group interpretive dance that resembled a poorly rehearsed musical.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Greg the drummer who unintentionally changed the course of the battle. In a moment of artistic fervor, he launched into an experimental drum riff so thunderous that it startled the mammoths into forming an organized retreat. The Mammoth-Riding Gorillas, confused by their own steeds&rsquo; coordination, assumed this was a tactical maneuver and immediately abandoned the field, shouting &ldquo;Victory!&rdquo; as they fled.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Samurai Gorillas, bewildered but proud, declared themselves the winners of the epic battle and celebrated by composing a haiku about bananas. Greg became a local legend, his drumming hailed as the most effective weapon of all time, and the mammoths returned to their true calling as connoisseurs of peanut butter sandwiches.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And thus, the Valley of Ludicrousness lived up to its name, and Gorillapolis continued its legacy as the most absurdly entertaining place in the universe&mdash;a fact not lost on the dolphins who watched from orbit and muttered, &ldquo;Idiots.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Douglas Adams were here, I think he&rsquo;d approve. Or at least politely chuckle. What do you think of Gorillapolis? Would you ride a mammoth or a bison?</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
