Planet of the Leaf Lords
Chapter 1: A New Dawn
Captain Elias Vance had seen many strange worlds, but none quite like Viridia-4. His landing pod hissed as it cooled, the thick green atmosphere swirling outside. His ship, The Horizon, remained in orbit, sending back live data to Earth.

“Command, this is Vance. I’ve landed safely. Oxygen’s rich, gravity’s close to Earth’s. Stepping out now.”

He pushed the hatch open, stepping onto the soft, mossy ground. Towering trees stretched high into the mist, their leaves the size of sailboats. The air smelled fresh, with a hint of something nutty.

Then he heard it—a deep, rhythmic chanting.

Chapter 2: The Leaf Lords
Vance crouched behind a massive root and peered through the foliage.

A procession moved through the jungle—a dozen massive gorilla-like beings, draped in woven cloaks of golden leaves. Their fur ranged from deep black to silver, their eyes filled with intelligence.

But the most incredible part? They were riding hairy bison the size of SUVs.

The bison’s thick woolly coats were braided with decorative vines, and their massive horns were painted with intricate symbols. At the center of the procession, a particularly regal-looking silverback rode a bison with gilded tusks. His cloak shimmered with thousands of layered leaves.

Vance’s translator buzzed in his ear, struggling to decipher the language.

“Honor... the Sky...”

Then the silverback raised a massive fist and pointed—right at Vance.

Chapter 3: The Trial of the Sky Walker
Within minutes, Vance was surrounded. The gorillas, or Viridians, didn’t attack but herded him onto a waiting bison. Its thick, shaggy fur smelled like fresh earth and—oddly—mint.

They rode to an enormous stone citadel, built into a mountainside, with waterfalls cascading down terraces. Inside, torches flickered, illuminating murals of gorillas watching the sky, carving symbols, and building machines.

Vance’s eyes widened. This wasn’t just a primitive society—this was a civilization on the verge of a Renaissance.

The silverback, now seated on a throne woven from roots and vines, studied Vance. His voice was a deep rumble, now slightly clearer through the translator.

“You fall from sky. Are you... god?”

Vance chuckled nervously. “Not quite.”

Chapter 4: The Debate of the Elders
The Viridian court murmured at Vance’s words. Some looked in awe, others in suspicion. One elder, his fur tinged with gray, leaned forward on his ornate staff.

“If not god,” he said, “then what?”

Vance chose his words carefully. “I am an explorer, a traveler from another world.” He pointed upward. “From the stars.”

The silverback stroked his chin. “The stars...” He turned to the other elders. “He speaks of the Sky Realm.”

More murmurs. A younger gorilla, smaller but draped in scholar’s robes, stepped forward. “We have watched the Sky Realm through our Great Tubes. We have seen lights that move unlike the stars. You are from there?”

Vance grinned. “You have telescopes?”

The young scholar puffed out his chest. “They were my invention. I am Ozu.”

An elder scoffed. “If he is from the Sky Realm, let him prove it.”

The silverback—who Vance now assumed was their leader—nodded. “Yes. A test.”

Chapter 5: The Trial of the Starborn
Vance swallowed. “What kind of test?”

Ozu’s face lit up. “You will ride against Chief Moktar in the Great Charge.”

“Uh... what?”

The elder banged his staff. “It is tradition! A test of mind, courage, and skill. If you are from the Sky Realm, surely you will triumph.”

Vance eyed Moktar, the massive silverback who had been silent until now. He cracked his knuckles and grinned.

“You fall from the sky,” Moktar said. “Let’s see if you can stay on a bison.”

Chapter 6: Bison and Bravery
Vance stood atop a raised platform, staring at his mount—a towering, muscle-bound, hairy bison. The beast snorted, its painted horns gleaming.

Ozu handed him a leaf-woven harness. “Good luck.”

Moktar mounted his own bison with ease, giving Vance a smug grin.

The rules were simple: race through the jungle, avoid obstacles, and reach the stone arch at the end. First to pass wins.

Vance took a deep breath and climbed onto his bison. It let out a deep, resonant snort—the sound of a creature that had seen too much nonsense in its life.

A Viridian elder raised a ceremonial leaf-staff. “BEGIN!”

The bison exploded into motion.

Chapter 7: A Sky Walker’s Trick
Branches whipped past Vance’s head as he clung to the harness. Moktar was ahead, his bison thundering through the dense foliage with practiced ease.

Vance gritted his teeth. “Okay, think, think...”

His bison was powerful, but he lacked control.

Then he remembered—his grav-boots.

With a flick of his wrist, he adjusted the gravity dampener in his boots. Instantly, his weight lightened, allowing him to shift effortlessly with the bison’s movements.

He crouched low, balancing perfectly. “Alright, big guy, let’s move.”

He tugged the reins, guiding the bison around a fallen tree instead of plowing through it like Moktar.

The silverback glanced back, eyes widening. “Sky magic?”

Vance grinned. “Nah. Just good physics.”

Chapter 8: The Legend is Born
With a final push, Vance’s bison surged ahead. The stone arch loomed near.

Moktar roared, pushing his beast forward. Neck and neck.

Vance whispered, “Come on, buddy. Just a little more.”

The bison leaped, clearing a final rock obstacle.

They crossed the arch first.

The crowd erupted in cheers. Ozu practically vibrated with excitement.

“The Sky Walker wins!”

Moktar skidded to a stop, panting. Then, to Vance’s surprise, he laughed.

“You ride well, Sky Walker.” He thumped his chest in respect.

The silverback leader stood, raising his arms. “Then it is true! He is from the Sky Realm. We must learn from him.”

Ozu grinned. “Teach us your wisdom, Sky Walker.”

Vance smiled. He hadn’t expected first contact to involve extreme bison racing, but here he was.

Maybe, just maybe, this was the beginning of something great.

The Renaissance of the Leaf Lords had begun.

The End (for now).
