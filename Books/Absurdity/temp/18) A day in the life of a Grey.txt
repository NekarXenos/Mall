**A Day in the Life of Blipnar on Glomulus IX**  

Glomulus IX was a planet of remarkable consistency. The sky was always a dull shade of pewter, the temperature hovered perpetually at a comfortable 22.3 degrees Celsius, and nothing particularly interesting ever happened. This suited the Greys perfectly, as they were not fans of surprises, loud noises, or anything that required more than mild curiosity.  

Blipnar awoke precisely at the allotted time, as all Greys did, because the sun never actually rose or set on Glomulus IX. It merely hung there, like a dim bulb someone had forgotten to switch off. Blipnar blinked his massive black eyes, yawned from his barely visible slit of a mouth, and floated out of bed with the grace of a helium balloon that wasn’t quite sure if it wanted to reach the ceiling.  

His habitat pod was, as mandated by the Grand Council of Utter Predictability, perfectly spherical and painted in a shade of grey so neutral it was often mistaken for a philosophical statement. Blipnar shuffled to the Nutrition Assimilator, which politely hummed before dispensing a blob of nutrient gel with all the flavor and excitement of damp cardboard. Greys didn’t eat for pleasure; they ate because not doing so resulted in highly inconvenient fainting spells.  

He slurped the gel, which required minimal chewing, an evolutionary quirk due to their tiny mouths and general dislike of unnecessary movement. As he swallowed, his oversized eyes drifted to the Information Orb, hovering obediently at eye level. It flickered to life, broadcasting the day’s news in soothing monotones:  

“Nothing of significance occurred yesterday. Forecast for today: mild temperature, no precipitation, and a continued absence of noteworthy events. The Council reminds all citizens to maintain tranquility and avoid any thoughts of spontaneity.”  

Blipnar nodded, satisfied. Spontaneity was the leading cause of mild anxiety, and mild anxiety was best avoided.  

It was time for his daily work shift at the Analysis Complex, where he was tasked with observing Earth and ensuring humans didn’t do anything too clever. This was largely unnecessary, as humans were quite good at being stupid without any interference. Nevertheless, it was protocol, and Greys loved protocol the way Earthlings loved cat videos.  

He floated into his Transport Bubble and drifted to the Complex, where identical Greys sat in identical spheres, gazing at monitors showing Earth’s broadcast signals. Blipnar’s monitor tuned to a human documentary entitled *Cooking for One: Embracing Your Crushing Loneliness.* He shuddered. Humans were baffling. They had emotions, which were like illnesses, except more contagious and vastly more inconvenient.  

He made a note: *Subject appears to be leaking from ocular cavities while consuming burnt vegetable matter. Hypothesis: Faulty nutrient assimilation technique or emotional malfunction.*  

Suddenly, his monitor flickered, then displayed static. Blipnar’s heart—small, efficient, and programmed to beat at a modest pace—skipped. Static was unpredictable. Static was... unexpected.  

Before his anxiety could fully blossom, the static cleared, revealing the face of a human in a strange red hat, speaking rapidly. Blipnar turned up the volume:  

“...and for just $19.99, you can get the complete collection! Call now and receive a bonus inflatable garden gnome!”  

Blipnar blinked. What was a garden gnome? He had to know. There was no protocol for this. His three-fingered hand trembled as he activated the Research Index. “Garden gnome,” he whispered. The computer whirred, then displayed an image of a tiny, grinning humanoid statue.  

Blipnar’s mouth twitched. It was the closest any Grey had come to a smile in over two centuries.  

A thought—wild, dangerous, and utterly irresponsible—crossed his mind: *I want one.*  

He shook his head, horrified by his own recklessness. Desire was the first step to deviation. Deviation led to unpredictability. Unpredictability was... fun.  

Blipnar exhaled slowly, calming himself. No one needed to know. No one would know. He glanced around. His colleagues stared blankly at their screens, blissfully unaware.  

Returning to his duties, Blipnar tried to focus on the documentary, but his mind wandered to the garden gnome. Maybe, just maybe, tomorrow would be a little less predictable.  

And for a Grey on Glomulus IX, that was as radical as it got.
