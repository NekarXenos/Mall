**The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything (Or, How Humans Tricked Their Way to Galactic Domination)**  

It was a perfectly ordinary afternoon on Earth, roughly 42,000 years before the invention of existential angst, when a flying saucer the shape of an extremely confused dinner plate descended onto the plains. It landed with a hum that sounded exactly like an electric toothbrush being used by someone trying very hard not to wake their partner.  

The Greys disembarked with the sort of awkward grace one achieves only after spending several centuries in zero gravity. They were short, bald, and entirely nude in that way that only beings without the slightest shred of shame or anatomy can manage. They glanced around the savannah, their large, unblinking eyes reflecting the light of a pleasantly indifferent sun.  

Their mission was simple: catalog primitive lifeforms, take a few soil samples, avoid unnecessary interactions, and for the love of Zog, don't do anything that could impact the species' development. This was the first rule in the Universal Guide for Non-Interference, which, like most such guides, was generally ignored as long as no one was watching.  

As the Greys began setting up their instruments, one of them, named Blorp (because names like that were funny to the writers of the Universe's base code), noticed something peculiar.  

A human, who had been crouching behind a bush with all the subtlety of a child playing hide and seek, stepped forward. He was covered in mud, leaves, and an air of caution. With a stick, he began scratching symbols into the dirt. The Greys watched, fascinated, as the human, whose name was probably Ug or something equally uninspired, drew two symbols: a "4" and a "2."  

Blorp's eyes widened, or would have if they weren't already at maximum wideness. "Do you see that?" he whispered in that conspiratorial tone favored by those about to be terribly wrong about something. "It's... it's a message."  

"What does it mean?" asked Zogwibble, his research partner who was mostly thinking about what they were having for dinner later.  

"It must be significant," Blorp whispered reverently. "Look at how reverently he made those shapes. Such symmetry! Such precision! Such... numbers!"  

Ug scratched his head, grunted in satisfaction, and wandered off to look for berries or a suitable mate—whichever came first.  

Blorp's mind raced. What could "42" signify? The number was elegant, harmonious, and appeared far too advanced for a species whose greatest achievement was not dying of dysentery.  

"Zogwibble," Blorp said with a tremor in his voice, "I think it means... God."  

They spent the next few days trying to communicate with the humans, who, after realizing the Greys were oddly fascinated by those two symbols, began drawing "42" on every available surface. On rocks, in the dirt, even on the side of the saucer, which took the Greys several weeks to scrub off.  

The humans, meanwhile, were quick learners. They watched the Greys operate their technology, mimicked their movements, and occasionally poked at buttons that really shouldn't be poked at. The Greys, mistaking the humans' curiosity for devotion, were flattered. They began teaching them basic concepts, like fire, the wheel, and interstellar navigation.  

"They're such eager little disciples," Blorp said one day, watching a human accidentally invent algebra while trying to draw a funny face. "They really take this '42' business seriously."  

The humans, meanwhile, were grinning like children who'd just learned where their parents hid the cookies. They didn't understand the Greys' language, but they did understand power. And the shiny things the Greys were waving around looked very powerful indeed.  

It wasn't long before the humans were building things they shouldn't have known how to build. Stone monoliths for interstellar communication, pyramids for energy amplification, and a rather impressive prototype for a subspace engine made entirely out of mammoth bones.  

"Maybe we shouldn't have taught them how to do that," Zogwibble said nervously as they watched the humans figure out faster-than-light travel using nothing but vines and optimism.  

"Nonsense," Blorp scoffed. "They worship us. What could possibly go wrong?"  

Exactly two weeks later, the first human fleet launched into the cosmos, led by a chieftain named Zorg who had figured out how to weaponize algebra. The Greys, who had been napping under a particularly nice tree, woke to find themselves surrounded by human starships made from rocks, animal hides, and inexplicably advanced quantum propulsion systems.  

The Greys were never seen again. History does not record whether they were politely asked to leave or launched into a neighboring dimension by an irritable war chief with a penchant for dramatic flair.  

The humans, meanwhile, went on to conquer the galaxy, establish a universal empire, and invent bureaucracy. They never did figure out what "42" meant, but they kept using it because it seemed important.  

And thus, the humans became the rulers of the universe, entirely by accident and without the slightest clue what they were doing—just as they had always done.
