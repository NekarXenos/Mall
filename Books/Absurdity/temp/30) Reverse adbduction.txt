**The Abduction of Dave McLoud**  

B08-Grey hovered silently above the Earth in his sleek, disc-shaped vessel, *The Abductotron*. It had been a slow night. His mission? The usual: scoop up a specimen, conduct routine tests, implant a vague memory of “lost time,” and drop them back before their primitive brain processed what happened. Simple. Efficient.  

Then he abducted Dave McLoud.  

The moment Dave materialized in the sterile examination room, he started talking. Loudly.  

"Whoa! Whoa! What is this? Oh, man, is this an alien ship? Are you one of those little grey guys? Dude, you’re tiny! What’s up with those eyes? Are you a telepath? Wait, wait—don’t tell me. If you’re reading my mind right now, I should think of something really weird. Okay, got it. Boom. How do you like *that* image?"  

B08-Grey, despite his extensive training in interspecies psychology, recoiled.  

"Cease vocal emissions," he said through the ship’s translator.  

Dave did not cease.  

"Man, this place is high-tech. What do these buttons do? OOH, is that a tractor beam? Can I push it? Can I drive the ship? You should totally let me drive the ship!"  

B08-Grey turned to his ship’s AI, CHRISPI. “Scan for cognitive anomalies. I suspect damage.”  

CHRISPI's blue light pulsed as it analyzed the subject. "Scan complete. No detectable neural impairment. This behavior appears... natural."  

B08-Grey had never encountered a species that *enjoyed* being abducted. Usually, there was screaming, sometimes fainting. Occasionally, a confused request for probing. But this one? This one was—  

"Wait. You're reading my thoughts, aren't you?" Dave squinted at B08-Grey. "Okay, but if you're reading my thoughts and I’m thinking about you reading my thoughts, does that mean you’re reading my thoughts about you reading my thoughts? Dude. That’s deep."  

B08-Grey blinked his massive black eyes.  

Dave grinned. "Oh, I broke you, didn’t I?"  

He had.  

B08-Grey, for the first time in his existence, felt doubt. He consulted the ship’s logs. The standard protocol for handling an anomaly was to return it immediately. But Dave was *worse* than an anomaly. He was *a disruption*. If returned to Earth, he could tell others about this experience, and while no one would believe him, the sheer *chaotic energy* of his presence might ripple outward, destabilizing the delicate balance of the human species.  

This required drastic action.  

"New plan," B08-Grey said.  

He pressed a button. The ship’s main console lit up with a new designation: **COMMAND TRANSFER INITIATED.**  

Dave looked around as the room shifted. "Wait, what’s happening?"  

"You are now the commanding officer of *The Abductotron*."  

Dave blinked. "Wait, *really*?"  

"It is the only logical solution."  

Dave cracked his knuckles. "Alright! First order of business: can we get some snacks up in here? Second, we're gonna abduct Elon Musk and make him *prove* he's not an alien."  

B08-Grey sighed.  

He was never getting his ship back.
