Dr. Reginald Throckmorton was the kind of scientist whose very presence made universities nervous. Not because he was unqualified—quite the opposite. He had six PhDs, three honorary doctorates, and a restraining order from the Nobel Committee after an incident involving an unlicensed particle accelerator and the Swedish royal family. No, the issue was that Reginald had a tendency to do things—things that had consequences. And academia, at its core, prefers consequences to remain firmly theoretical.

His latest endeavor was what he called the Transdimensional Quantum Entanglement Perambulator, which, despite sounding like a steampunk baby stroller, was, in fact, a portal to another world. Or possibly a very aggressive microwave. Either way, it was guaranteed to make reality deeply uncomfortable.

His lab assistant, Mila, was a skeptical young woman whose primary job was to remind Dr. Throckmorton that just because something was theoretically possible didn’t mean it should be attempted indoors. She had a special fire extinguisher labeled "For Reginald’s Shenanigans" and kept a preemptive apology letter addressed to "whom it may concern" at all times.

"Mila!" Reginald bellowed from behind a mass of wires, blinking lights, and at least one piece of alien technology he absolutely should not have had. "Throw the lever!"

"Which one?" Mila asked, surveying the bank of suspiciously sparking switches.

"The big one. With the skull and crossbones."

"That one says 'DO NOT THROW UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.'"

"Exactly! If it was safe, I wouldn’t need an assistant."

With the long-suffering sigh of a woman who had, at this point, simply accepted her fate, Mila threw the lever. There was a deep whomph, the scent of singed eyebrows (her own, regrettably), and suddenly, a glowing rift in space-time appeared before them.

It shimmered with the sort of light that physicists described as "non-Euclidean" and regular people described as "I need to sit down." Then, before either of them could say something pithy about the laws of physics being overrated, the rift yoinked them both through.

They landed in a heap on the other side, Mila clutching the fire extinguisher like a security blanket.

"Mila," Reginald whispered, staring around in awe. "I think we’ve just discovered the home planet of the Greys."

And indeed, they had. It was a vast, sprawling world covered in sleek, mysterious architecture, an unsettling number of blinking lights, and what appeared to be an entire bureaucracy dedicated to probing things that really ought to be left unprobed.

A short, spindly Grey alien in a lab coat wandered over, regarding them with large black eyes that somehow managed to express equal parts curiosity and exasperation.

"Oh, for the love of the Grand Cosmic Conspiracy," the Grey sighed. "How did you two get here?"

"Quantum entanglement!" Reginald beamed. "And also a mild disregard for personal safety."

The Grey pinched the bridge of his oddly smooth nose. "Great. Another leak in the dimensional shielding. That’s the third one this eon. The council is going to have my head for this."

"Council?" Mila asked warily.

"The Grand Intergalactic Council of Secrecy and Misinformation," the Grey explained. "We handle cover-ups, disinformation campaigns, and the occasional crop circle maintenance. My name’s Vylqx, and I am absolutely not supposed to be explaining this to you."

"So you are responsible for all those conspiracies!" Reginald exclaimed, delighted.

Vylqx sighed again, the weariness of a bureaucrat who had been responsible for far too many memory wipes. "Yes, yes, fine. Greys are real. We’ve been visiting Earth for millennia. But honestly, you people make our jobs easy. Half the time, we don’t even need to cover things up. Humans do it for us."

Mila frowned. "What do you mean?"

Vylqx led them to a giant holographic screen displaying live Earth footage. "Look at this," he said, pointing to a particularly blurry video of a flying saucer. "What do humans do? Immediately post it on the internet, where—within minutes—it’s surrounded by comments arguing about whether it’s CGI, swamp gas, or a trick of the light. You lot invented misinformation way before we did. We’re just… facilitating."

Reginald was practically vibrating with excitement. "So, you mean all the conspiracy theories are real?"

Vylqx hesitated. "Some of them. Others are just nonsense humans made up that we then had to make real so people wouldn’t get too close to the actual truth. It’s a nightmare, honestly. Do you know how much effort it takes to make sure Bigfoot is seen just often enough to remain a mystery but not enough to be verifiable?"

Mila rubbed her temples. "This is giving me a headache. Can we go home now?"

Vylqx sighed and pointed to a glowing portal in the distance. "Fine. But if anyone asks, you were abducted by a swamp gas balloon in the shape of Venus, okay? We’ve got a reputation to maintain."

Reginald grinned as they stepped through the portal back to their lab. "Mila," he said, practically giddy, "I think we’ve just discovered the greatest scientific truth in history."

Mila shook her head. "You mean the greatest conspiracy in history."

Reginald considered this, then beamed. "Even better!"
