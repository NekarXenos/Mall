### *Love at First Abduction*  

#### Chapter 1: In Which a Flying Saucer Meddles in Romance  

There are many ways to meet the love of your life. You could, for instance, accidentally order their coffee at a café and then be forced to drink something called a "mocha oat milk foam delight" while gagging politely. You could also bump into them at a bookstore, reach for the same novel, and have an awkwardly intense moment of eye contact that results in marriage three years later.  

Or, if you're particularly unlucky, you could be kidnapped by an alien in a flying saucer and wake up in your underwear next to a complete stranger.  

This is precisely what happened to Ethan Bell and Sophie Carter.  

Ethan, an IT specialist with a crippling fear of public speaking and mild allergies to everything, had been abducted from his tiny apartment in Croydon while brushing his teeth. He was still holding his toothbrush, which was deeply unsettling, as he had no idea where the toothpaste had gone.  

Sophie, a microbiologist and noted skeptic of all things paranormal, had been taken mid-lecture, explaining to a room full of students why alien abductions were just a mixture of sleep paralysis, bad dreams, and a desperate need for attention. This was somewhat ironic.  

They found themselves in a smooth, silver room, lying on a table under an uncomfortably bright light, while an extremely unimpressed Grey alien examined a clipboard.  

"Good, you’re both awake," said the alien, in perfect English. "Let’s get started, shall we?"  

#### Chapter 2: Love is Highly Probable (Statistically Speaking)  

The alien, who introduced himself as Bob (short for B08-GREY), tapped his clipboard with the air of someone who had far too many abductees to process that night.  

"Right. You two are a statistically significant romantic match. 99.87 percent compatibility, according to my database. You should already be experiencing mild attraction. Do you feel it? A bit of tingling? Maybe a sudden, inexplicable appreciation for each other's scent?"  

Ethan and Sophie stared at each other.  

Sophie, dressed in her pajama top and mismatched socks, crossed her arms. "This is ridiculous. Who abducts people for dating purposes?"  

Bob sighed, the long-suffering sigh of an alien who had to deal with primitive species and their irrational approach to relationships. "Honestly, you humans are terrible at mating rituals. Swiping left, swiping right, ghosting, benching, breadcrumbing—do you have any idea how frustrating it is watching you lot fumble around? I mean, you've practically destroyed your own planet because nobody wants to just talk to each other!"  

Ethan blinked. "Wait. You mean... this is an alien dating service?"  

"Exactly," Bob said. "Intergalactic Love Bureau, Grey Division. I abduct humans who are too socially incompetent to find partners on their own and give them a little push. You’re welcome."  

Sophie groaned. "This is ridiculous. I do fine on my own, thank you very much."  

Bob glanced at his clipboard. "Oh? Last relationship ended three years ago when the guy ghosted you via text message and then married your cousin."  

Sophie turned red. "That is—completely irrelevant!"  

Bob turned to Ethan. "And you? Last date was six months ago, ended with you spilling pasta sauce all over yourself and apologizing seventeen times before she said she just ‘wasn’t feeling the spark’?"  

Ethan sank into his seat. "I don’t like this game."  

#### Chapter 3: The Date From Above  

Bob clapped his hands, or at least made a sound that suggested he had clapped his hands, even though he didn’t have fingers. "Right, so we’ll make this easy. You two will now be placed on a lovely, simulated date in a neutral environment. If you pass, I’ll drop you off back on Earth, happily in love. If you fail, well… I’ll have to wipe your memories and try again next week with different people."  

Sophie squinted. "Wait. Are you saying we’ve done this before?"  

Bob gave them a mysterious smile.  

Before either of them could protest, the room shimmered, reality twisted in on itself, and suddenly they were sitting at a candlelit table in what appeared to be a high-end restaurant floating in the middle of deep space. A massive view of the Milky Way sparkled through the transparent walls. Soft music played. A waiter, who appeared to be a sentient blob of green goo, handed them menus.  

Sophie rubbed her temples. "This is actually happening."  

Ethan nervously picked up his menu. "Uh… what’s ‘Nebulon Surprise’?"  

The waiter burbled enthusiastically.  

Ethan nodded. "Right. I’ll have the salad."  

Sophie sighed. "Okay, let’s get this over with. What do you do for a living?"  

Ethan smiled awkwardly. "I… uh… fix computers."  

Sophie groaned. "Oh, good. A tech guy. Look, no offense, but I bet you think Linux is a personality trait, don’t you?"  

Ethan’s ears turned pink. "I—well—I mean, it’s more stable than—"  

Bob’s voice interrupted from above. "Less arguing, more romance, please!"  

Ethan and Sophie exchanged a look.  

Then, despite themselves, they laughed.  

#### Chapter 4: A Slight Malfunction (In Both the Spaceship and Their Hearts)  

Just as things were starting to feel… less terrible, an alarm blared.  

"Uh-oh," Bob muttered. "That’s not good."  

The restaurant wobbled, then flickered, then vanished entirely, dumping Ethan and Sophie back onto the cold metal floor of the saucer. Red warning lights flashed.  

Ethan groaned. "What now?"  

Bob adjusted some controls. "Tiny problem. We’re about to be shot down by a trigger-happy government agency. Hold on, I need to do some evasive maneuvers."  

The saucer lurched violently to the left.  

Sophie and Ethan tumbled into each other.  

"Sorry about this," Bob said. "First dates are always a bit bumpy."  

Sophie, now practically in Ethan’s lap, looked at him. "I swear, if we survive this, I’ll agree to one real date."  

Ethan grinned. "You promise not to mock my Linux setup?"  

Sophie groaned. "Fine. But if you say the words ‘open-source’ more than once, I’m walking out."  

Bob, dodging a missile, sighed in satisfaction. "See? I *knew* this would work."  

And with that, the saucer blinked out of existence, leaving behind nothing but a confused military pilot and two very bewildered humans who, despite everything, were now holding hands.
