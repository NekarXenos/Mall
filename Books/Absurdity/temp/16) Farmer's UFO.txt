Alright, here’s a rough draft for the comedy:

### Title: *The Accidental Astronauts*  

**Scene 1: The Discovery**  
*On a quiet farm, Jeb and Martha are inspecting a strange, smoking crater in their cornfield.*  

**Jeb:** Martha, you been buyin’ them fancy fertilizers again?  
**Martha:** Nope. But whatever this is, it’s killed half my crop!  

*They approach the crater to find a dented flying saucer, sputtering and making odd noises.*  

**Jeb:** Well, I’ll be... It’s one of them UFO thingamajigs.  
**Martha:** Hmph. Looks like it’s made of tin. Betcha we can fix it up.  

*Cue a montage of Jeb and Martha using farm tools and duct tape to patch up the saucer. Jeb even kicks it once for good measure.*  

---

**Scene 2: The First Flight**  
*The saucer lights up. Inside, it’s all buttons and levers with alien symbols.*  

**Jeb:** Can’t be that different from drivin’ a tractor...  

*He presses a button. The saucer whirrs and takes off with a lurch, knocking them into the seats.*  

**Martha:** Jeb, I think you missed the brake pedal!  
**Jeb:** This thing don’t have no brake pedal!  

*They scream as the saucer zooms upward, stars streaking by. The farm shrinks below until Earth is just a blue dot.*  

**Jeb:** Well, shoot. I think I took a wrong turn.  

---

**Scene 3: A New World**  
*The saucer lands with a thud on a strange planet. The trees are purple, and small, ape-like aliens peek out from behind bushes, whispering in a foreign tongue.*  

**Martha:** Looks like they’re stuck in the Stone Age.  
**Jeb:** More like the Flintstone Age.  

*One curious alien approaches, sniffing Martha’s apron. It pokes her arm and grunts. She swats its hand away.*  

**Martha:** Ain’t you got no manners?  

*Jeb tries to communicate by pantomiming milking a cow. The aliens mimic him, then start dancing around, mooing loudly.*  

**Martha:** What in tarnation are they doin’?  
**Jeb:** Think they’re worshippin’ the cow gods.  

---

**Scene 4: Trading Up**  
*Jeb tries to trade his pocket knife for some alien fruit. The alien examines the knife, accidentally presses the button, and the blade flicks out.*  

*The alien yelps and runs off, waving the knife. The other aliens drop to their knees, bowing to Jeb.*  

**Martha:** Great. You made ‘em think you’re some kinda metal magician.  
**Jeb:** Well, maybe they’ll help us fix that saucer then.  

---

**Scene 5: The Return Home**  
*With the aliens’ help, they repair the saucer. Before they leave, Martha hands out homemade cookies. The aliens sniff them cautiously, then devour them with joy.*  

**Martha:** Guess I’m the first interstellar baker.  

*They wave goodbye as the saucer lifts off. The aliens dance below, chanting, “Coo-kie! Coo-kie!”*  

**Jeb:** Well, Martha, I reckon we just started a religion.  
**Martha:** Let’s just get home before the cows think we’ve abandoned ‘em.  

*The saucer zips away, disappearing into the stars.*  

**End Scene.**
