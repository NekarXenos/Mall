Navigating Miniature Worlds: Implementing First/Third-Person Character Control and Multi-Planet Travel in Three.js
Executive Summary: Mastering Spherical Worlds and Interstellar Travel in Three.js
Developing a first or third-person game character that can traverse mini-planets and seamlessly transition between celestial bodies in Three.js presents a significant technical challenge. Traditional game physics models, designed for flat environments, are fundamentally inadequate for spherical surfaces. This report addresses the complexities involved, from implementing custom radial gravity and maintaining character orientation on curved terrain to managing physics across multiple gravitational fields and ensuring smooth inter-planetary travel. It consolidates current best practices, identifies valuable Three.js libraries and community resources, and highlights advanced considerations for building a robust and immersive game experience. The analysis confirms that while intricate, achieving player-centric spherical movement and cosmic exploration within Three.js is entirely feasible with a structured approach to physics, mathematics, and scene management.
1. The Core Challenge: Character Movement on Spherical Surfaces
The aspiration to enable a game character to walk on a mini-planet, as well as journey to its moon and other celestial bodies, immediately surfaces a fundamental distinction from conventional game development: the nature of gravity and surface interaction. The observation that some developers opt to rotate the planet beneath the player rather than moving the player on the planet underscores the inherent difficulty of this problem. This section explores the underlying reasons for this complexity.
1.1 Why Standard Gravity Fails on Planets
Traditional game engines and basic physics implementations often rely on a simplified gravity model. This model typically applies a constant, downward force along a fixed axis, such as the global Y-axis. This "flat-earth" gravity is perfectly functional for games set on planar or relatively flat terrains. However, its application to a spherical surface leads to immediate and fundamental inaccuracies. As a character moves across a planet's curved surface, the local "down" direction continuously shifts, always pointing towards the planet's center. If a fixed downward force were applied, the character would inevitably drift away from the surface or appear to fall off as they moved towards the "sides" or "bottom" of the sphere.
The workaround, where the planet rotates underneath a stationary player, directly circumvents this challenge. By keeping the player's "down" direction fixed relative to the screen or world, the need for complex, dynamic character physics is eliminated. However, this simplification comes at a significant cost: it severely limits player agency and the realism of movement. A player cannot truly "walk around" a planet in this scenario, nor can they transition to other celestial bodies, as each body would require its own complex, fixed rotation relative to the player, leading to an unmanageable system for multi-planet exploration.
To achieve authentic spherical gravity, the gravitational force must be calculated as a vector pointing from the character's current position directly towards the center of the planet. This vector is then normalized to define the precise "up" or "down" direction relative to the character's immediate environment. For instance, in a Unity context, this involves calculating gravityUp = (player.transform.position - planet.transform.position).normalized; and then applying a force based on this direction. This mathematical approach, where gravity is radial rather than axial, is directly transferable to Three.js. In contrast, simpler 2D gravity models, as seen in basic JavaScript examples, merely increment a dy (vertical velocity) value to simulate a constant downward pull, which is insufficient for a curved surface. The core problem, therefore, is not just about applying a force, but about dynamically redefining the orientation of that force base
